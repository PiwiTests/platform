# Playwright Dashboard — Agent Instructions

This file provides project context for any AI agent (opencode, Copilot, Cursor, etc.).

## Project Overview

Playwright test results dashboard built with **Nuxt 4**, Nuxt UI dashboard template. Stores and displays Playwright test results organized by projects.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+, npm, Git
- Commands run from `application/` unless noted

## Repository Structure

```
application/       — Nuxt 4 dashboard app
application/tests/ — Functional tests (Playwright)
reporter/          — Custom Playwright reporter package
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd application
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

SQLite database auto-initializes on first API call.

## Architecture

### Database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (SQLite via libSQL, or PostgreSQL via postgres.js)
- **Schema**: `application/server/database/schema.ts`
- **Migrations**: `application/server/database/migrations/` (SQLite) or `migrations-pg/` (PostgreSQL, auto-run on startup based on `DATABASE_URL`)
- **Tables**: `projects`, `test_runs`, `test_cases`, `test_runs_cases`, `traces`, `users`

### Backend (server/api/)
Nuxt file-based routing:
- `POST /api/test-runs/submit` — Submit JSON test results
- `POST /api/test-runs/upload` — Upload with HTML reports + traces
- `GET /api/projects` — List projects with stats
- `GET /api/projects/[id]` — Project details + runs
- `GET /api/test-runs/[id]` — Run details + cases
- `GET /api/test-cases/[id]` — Case details + traces
- `GET /api/files/[...path]` — Download reports/traces

### Frontend (app/pages/)
- `/` — Dashboard home with stats
- `/projects` — Project list
- `/projects/[id]` — Project detail
- `/test-runs/[id]` — Run detail
- `/test-cases/[id]` — Case detail

### Reporter
- `reporter/index.js` — Custom Playwright reporter
- `reporter/index.d.ts` — TypeScript types
- `reporter/package.json` — NPM package

## Key Features
- Auto-create projects on submission
- Stores: status, duration, errors, HTML reports (full directory with assets), trace files
- File storage: `.data/storage/` — paths stored relative to storage dir
- REST + multipart upload APIs

## Code Style
- Keep it simple (AI-friendly codebase)
- Full TypeScript, Nuxt 4 conventions, Nuxt UI components
- Sentence case in UI (e.g., "Test runs"), relative dates with date-fns, human-readable durations
- Use American English spelling throughout (e.g., "initialize", "organize", "color")

## Environment
- `.env.example` in `application/` — `NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (optional)
- Works with no env vars set; `.data/` created automatically

## Dev Commands (from `application/`)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm install` | Install deps |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript check |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm test` | Run functional tests |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate migration |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply migrations |
| `npm run db:push` | Push schema (dev only) |
| `npm run db:studio` | Drizzle Studio |

## Making Changes

- **DB fields**: Update `schema.ts` → `npm run db:generate` (or `db:generate:pg` for PostgreSQL) → review migration → restart
  ⚠ Never create migration files or edit `_journal.json` manually — always use `npm run db:generate`.
- **API endpoints**: Create file in `server/api/` → use `eventHandler()` + `getDatabase()`
- **Pages**: Create Vue file in `app/pages/` → use `<UDashboardPanel>` + `useFetch()`
- **Navigation**: Edit `app/layouts/default.vue` links array
- **Tests**: Create `.spec.ts` in `application/tests/` → run `npm test`
- **Reporter**: Edit `reporter/index.js` + `index.d.ts` → test with `npm link`

## UI Best Practices
- Sentence case headings/labels
- Relative dates via date-fns (full timestamp on hover)
- Human-readable durations (exact ms on hover)

## Documentation (keep in sync with code)
- `docs/` — VitePress site published to GitHub Pages
- `README.md` — Landing page
- Update the relevant doc in the same commit as code changes (see `docs/` files for what each covers)

## Troubleshooting
- DB locked? Stop other processes accessing `.data/playwright.db`
- Port 3000 in use? Use `PORT=3001 npm run dev`
- Tests failing? Ensure no dev server on port 3000 (tests start their own)
- Reporter not found? `npm link` in `reporter/` then in target project
- Migration not applying? If a migration file or `_journal.json` was created by hand (not via `npm run db:generate`), the Drizzle migrator may silently skip it — delete the hand-written migration, revert the journal entry, run `npm run db:generate` (or `db:generate:pg` for PostgreSQL), and manually run `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` on the existing database if needed.

## Testing API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-runs/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"projectName":"my-project","status":"passed","startTime":"2024-01-01T12:00:00Z","duration":120000,"totalTests":10,"passedTests":9,"failedTests":1,"skippedTests":0,"testCases":[{"title":"should login","status":"passed","duration":1500,"location":"tests/login.spec.ts:10:5"}]}'
```

## Important Notes
- DB auto-initialized on first API call
- Projects auto-created on first submission
- Dates stored as Unix timestamps in SQLite
- Run typecheck, lint, and tests before final commit
