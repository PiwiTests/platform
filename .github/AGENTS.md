# CI workflows: agent instructions

Area guide for `.github/`: the GitHub Actions workflows, the composite action they share, and Dependabot. The plan
these follow, with its measurements and the phases still open, is
[`proposals/ci-workflows.md`](../proposals/ci-workflows.md).

| `actions/setup-workspace/action.yml`       | used by the workflows above     | Node, the npm cache, `npm ci`, and Playwright's Chromium when asked                      |

`ci.yml`'s `changes` job reads which areas a change touches (`dorny/paths-filter`) and each job runs for the areas it
covers; a change to `.github/workflows/`, `.github/actions/` or `.node-version` runs them all. It also picks the
matrices: a pull request runs the dashboard E2E suite on two backends (`local + sqlite` on Node 22, `s3 + postgres`)
and the package smoke test on Linux (on Windows and macOS too when it changes the packages or their dependencies);
`main` runs the four backends and the three systems. The JetBrains Plugin Verifier runs on two IDEs for a pull request
and on four on `main`, where the plugin job also writes the Gradle cache. The extension, VS Code and desktop suites run
on pull requests only, and so does the performance comparison, which builds the base commit once (cached by its sha)
and reports a regression in its comment without failing. The release PR runs the `Versions` job alone.

## Conventions

- **One required check.** A new check is a job of `ci.yml` (or a reusable workflow it calls) listed in the `needs` of
  `CI result`, never a separate required check. A job skipped by its `if` counts as passed; a workflow its path filter
  never started stays pending, so gate jobs on `needs.changes.outputs.*`, not workflows on `paths`.
- **A job that runs on some events and not others is never a required check of the same name** in another run on the
  same commit: the latest run of a check is the one branch protection reads. `pr-lint.yml` runs every job on every
  event for this reason.
- **Node through `setup-workspace`.** The version comes from the root `.node-version`; a job names another only to test
  a floor (`engines`, Node 22) or a bundled runtime (the desktop's `24.21.0`). `npm ci` runs with
  `--prefer-offline --no-audit --fund=false`.
- **Playwright's headless shell is cached by Playwright version** (`playwright: shell`). The full Chromium build
  (`playwright: full`) is installed on every run: its workflows run on pull requests only, where a cache serves its own
  pull request alone.
- **Least privilege.** `permissions: contents: read` on every workflow; anything more on the job that needs it. A job
  that calls a reusable workflow grants the permissions its jobs ask for: a called job asking for more fails the run.
- **Publishing only from a release tag.** A publishing step runs when `github.ref` is a `v*` tag (`TAG_BUILD`), or
  `main` for the `edge` image; anywhere else the workflow builds and packs, so a pull request can run it.
- **Bounded.** `timeout-minutes` on every job, about three times its usual duration.
- **Readable.** A `name` on every step, and a `name:` on every workflow that says what it does.
- **Superseded runs cancelled.** Every pull-request workflow has
  `concurrency: { group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}, cancel-in-progress: true }`.
  A reusable workflow has none: there `github.workflow` is the caller's name, so its group would collide with the
  caller's and cancel the run.
- **Artifacts expire.** An explicit `retention-days` on every artifact: 1 day for the ones jobs hand to each other.
- **Comments state the rule** the workflow follows, as everywhere in the repository (see the root `AGENTS.md`).

## Checking a change

- Run `actionlint` before pushing (`pr-lint.yml` runs it on every pull request):
  `docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo -e SHELLCHECK_OPTS=--severity=warning rhysd/actionlint:1.7.12 -color`.
  It runs shellcheck on the `run` scripts, at the warning level.
- A change under `.github/workflows/` or `.github/actions/` runs every suite on its pull request, which exercises it.
  A change to `release.yml` or a `reusable-publish-*.yml` also runs `release.yml` on its pull request: every target
  builds and packs, and nothing is published.
- Dependabot updates the actions of the workflows and of `.github/actions/*`.
