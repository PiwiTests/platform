# Test Map: fuller inputs, measured accuracy, and the extension

A plan for the second generation of the Test Map ([`adr/scenario-gaps.md`](../adr/scenario-gaps.md)). The first
shipped its three milestones quickly; this one starts from what it gets wrong on a realistic project, fills the
inputs it never writes, adds the signals a team already owns elsewhere, gives the map indicators of its own
accuracy, and joins it with the browser extension, which already sees the one thing the map cannot: the whole
rendered surface of a page.

**Status.** Proposed 2026-10-09. Part 1 items 1 to 5 and 8 to 10 have shipped, and item 6 in part: page reach
along the journey (read from the locator pages the reporter already sends, so no new capture), control reach from
the locator index, *API-only route* retired, nodes only untrusted tests reach raised as fragile, feature grouping
beyond reach with hubs, surface drift limited to new surface, unhandled server-probe findings, muting in the digest
and the tab, and churn and escape history for route, handler and dependency gaps. Part 3's labeled benchmark has
shipped too. The rest is proposed. The findings table and the summary describe the demo as it was proposed; with the
shipped items its detectors find 86 gaps, 21 of them controls no locator targets, 14 open gaps sit under
*Ungrouped* instead of 48, and the benchmark scores every detector at precision 1. The evidence comes from the web-dashboard demo project
(`shared/demo/demo-test-map.mjs`), whose gaps are exactly what the live detectors compute from its graph
(`tests/unit/demo-test-map.test.ts` recomputes them on the seed). New wire fields, attachments and endpoints freeze
at 1.0 and get an entry in [`1.0-stabilization.md`](1.0-stabilization.md).

**Summary.** The demo models an admin console: 4 features, 16 observed routes, 10 declared ones, 17 pages, 34
controls, 16 links, 16 handlers, 7 dependencies, and 10 tests; 120 nodes and 244 edges. The detectors find 61 gaps. About a third are
wrong or missing in ways the code explains, not the model: every route a click sends reads as "reached only by
request fixtures", a page a test walks through reads as "never visited", the nodes only a flaky test reaches raise
nothing, features never group the surface their tests miss, and every node gap ranks on the floor value of three of
its four exposure factors. Part 1 fixes those with data Piwi already stores. Part 2 adds inputs, ordered by cost.
Part 3 defines two families of indicators: how well the suite covers the application, and how far the Test Map's
own estimate can be trusted, with the demo turned into a labeled benchmark. Part 4 makes the extension's Tested
elements overlay a client of the Test Map and a source for it. Part 5 lists larger bets, each behind an entry
condition, the way the first record did.

## What the demo shows

| # | Finding | Where in the code | On the demo |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A test reaches only the page it **ends** on; pages it walks through count as unvisited | `pageUrlOf` in `server/utils/graph-ingest.ts` reads `page_state.url` | `/users/invite is linked but never visited`, although *invites a user by email* opens it |
| 2 | No `test → control` reach is ever written, and *control nobody exercises* stays silent until one exists | `detectControlNobodyExercises` gate in `shared/handlers/scenario-gaps.ts` | 0 control gaps for 34 inventoried controls, *Delete organization* and *Transfer ownership* among them |
| 3 | Network capture records only the page's own requests (`page.on('requestfinished')`), so no observed route is reached by request fixtures alone; `triggers` edges are never written either | `detectApiOnlyRoute` | all 8 click-sent routes flagged *API-only*; the demo team dismissed 5 as wrong |
| 4 | *Single covering test* needs exactly one trusted test; a node only untrusted tests reach raises nothing | `detectSingleCoveringTest` (`trustedTests.length !== 1`) | `/settings/appearance` and its two routes, reached only by the flaky dark-mode test: no gap at all |
| 5 | A feature groups only the nodes its tests reach | `syncFeatureNodes` | 25 of 61 gaps sit under *Ungrouped*; the feature map cannot show what a feature misses |
| 6 | Hub nodes join every feature | `getFeatureMap` link rule | `GET /api/session`, reached by 9 of 10 tests, links all four features and puts "9 tests" on each |
| 7 | The project-wide recompute never receives exposure; churn, age and escape history stay at 0.1 for every node gap | callers of `computeScenarioGaps` | 61 scores between 0.035 and 0.141, ordered by detector confidence |
| 8 | Route keys keep the redacted query, so one endpoint can be several route nodes | `normalizeRoute` in `@piwitests/core/page-key` | the model avoids queries; a real `?page=` and `?role=` split `GET /api/users` in two |
| 9 | Surface drift flags derived nodes and the first build; link keys are prefixed twice | `detectSurfaceDrift` over every node kind | a recompute of the checkout demo raises *New feature Checkout — confirm it is tested*; *New link link:Single sign-on* |
| 10 | Server probe findings are only ever *degraded* | `classifyProbeHandled` (reporter) returns graceful or degraded; `classifyHandled` (server) has no caller | one degraded finding; *unhandled* cannot occur |
| 11 | Muting withholds the *changed, unreached* pull-request section and nothing else | `change-coverage.ts` | a muted detector keeps its rows in the tab, the digest and the Home queue |
| 12 | Eleven detectors are pure functions with no caller | phantom coverage, passed with errors, catalog method, incidental catch, assertion-light, intent, new error path, new control, matrix, tracker escapes, locator break ahead | their inputs mostly exist (steps, console, backend logs, function catalog, diffs) |

Findings 1 to 4 make the map say wrong things; 5 to 7 make it hard to read; 8 to 12 are smaller. None needs a new
capture.

## Decisions

| D | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Fix the substrate before adding sources | most wrong gaps come from inputs Piwi has and does not join |
| D2 | Every new input is an origin on the existing nodes and edges | one substrate; a detector names the origin it read |
| D3 | A percentage only over a surface with a known denominator | the first record's rule ("not a percentage") stands for observed surface; a declared or fully rendered surface has a denominator |
| D4 | The map measures its own accuracy, on every project and on a labeled benchmark | precision from triage measures only what people bother to triage |
| D5 | The extension reads the map and writes to it, with consent, role and name only | it sees the rendered surface, states included, that no capture records |
| D6 | Production signals come from tools a team already runs | the mabl lesson in the first record: a signal that needs its own hookup stays off |

## Part 1: fix the substrate

1. **Page reach along the journey** (shipped). A test reaches every own-origin page it ran a locator call on, read
   from the `piwi-locator-pages` attachment the capture fixtures send on every execution, as well as the page it
   ended on; the graph rebuild reads the stored payloads too. Fixes finding 1 and gives *single covering test* the
   right count. A page a test only navigates through, without a locator call, stays unreached.
2. **Control reach from the locator index** (shipped). Each recompute reads the default branch's locator index
   (`locator_usages`, what the extension's overlay evaluates) and parses each chain with
   `@piwitests/core/locator-chain`: a `getByRole(role, { name })` maps to a `role:name` control or link key
   (confidence 1), an alternative its locator snapshot captured on the same line for the same call maps the same
   way (0.9), a name without `exact` maps to the one node of its role whose name holds it, as Playwright matches
   (0.8), and a label, placeholder or title maps to the one labeled-role control carrying that name (0.8) or holding
   it (0.7). It writes `test → control` and `test → link` reaches with `evidence.action` = `operated` or `checked`
   and the use's own last-seen time, which wakes *control nobody exercises* (finding 2). A test id or CSS chain whose
   snapshot has no role alternative maps to nothing, and when it operated an element, the controls of its page are
   not raised as untested or single-covered; the element the snapshot resolved to (`element_tag`, `element_attrs`)
   would map it.
3. **Retire *API-only route*** (shipped). Its claim, *reached only by request fixtures*, cannot hold for any
   observed route, since only the page's own requests are captured; trigger edges would have hidden the noise, not
   fixed the claim. The recompute closes its open rows and keeps the dismissed ones. Trigger edges are still worth
   writing for the extension's gap layer (Part 4, item 1): action steps carry start times, requests carry start
   times, and `requestInStepWindow` already pads the window.
4. **Untrusted-only nodes** (shipped). A node with no trusted test and at least one untrusted one is a fragile
   *single covering test* gap, *No trusted test reaches …*, naming each test and whether it is flaky,
   quarantined or skipped (finding 4).
5. **Feature grouping beyond reach, and hubs** (shipped). For what no feature reaches, a feature also groups, with
   origin `inferred` and a confidence below one: the controls its pages contain (0.8), the pages they link to under
   the same first path segment (0.6) and those pages' controls (0.5), and declared routes sharing the first two path
   segments of a route it reaches (0.6). With three features or more, a node reached by more than half the tests, or
   grouped by more than half the features, is a hub (`evidence.hub`): drawn, but adding no member, test, gap or link
   to a feature, its gaps listed under *Shared by most features* (findings 5 and 6). The groups are rebuilt on every
   recompute. Still proposed: OpenAPI tags, which the parser does not keep, and grouping dependencies.
6. **Exposure for node gaps** (churn and escape history shipped). A gap on a route, a handler or a dependency
   takes churn and escape history from the handler files behind it (`handled-by`), counted from the `changes`
   edges the default-branch runs recorded and the failure clusters' fixing commits, so no provider call is made
   (finding 7). A run's diff runs from its last green run, so churn counts distinct diff bases, and escape history
   marks the whole diff that ended on the fix; per-commit files would make both exact. Still proposed: page files by convention, and age from the file's first commit, read once from the
   provider and cached.
7. **Route keys without the query.** The node key drops the query; the parameter names move to `attrs.query`.
   A migration merges the split nodes and their edges (finding 8).
8. **Drift on surface only, and not at the first build** (shipped). Drift is a new node no test reaches, as the
   first record defined it: a new node a test already reaches is covered. Feature nodes never drift, the run that
   built the project's graph first (pruned nodes included) raises none, and a link's title names it once
   (finding 9). Requiring no reach also keeps the pages that item 1 adds to existing graphs from reading as new.
9. **Unhandled findings** (shipped). Under a server probe the capture fixtures count uncaught page errors and
   read whether the page is blank before it closes; an uncaught error, or a backend error with a blank page, is
   *unhandled* (finding 10).
10. **Muting everywhere** (shipped). A muted detector's rows leave the digest as well as the pull-request
    comment, and the Gaps tab lists them last, under *Muted detectors* (finding 11). The Home queue keeps them:
    each is a gap a person accepted.
11. **Wire the cheap pure detectors.** *Passed with errors* (console errors, backend `Error` logs and background 5xx
    on passing executions, all stored), *assertion-light* (from `step-analysis.ts`) and *catalog method no test
    calls* (from `test_functions`) need no new data (finding 12).

On the demo, items 1, 3, 4 and 8 took the detected gaps from 61 to 54: *API-only* went from 8 rows to 0,
*reachable, unvisited* lost `/users/invite`, `/login` and `/settings/organization` stopped reading as
single-covered, and three fragile gaps appeared for the dark-mode test's nodes. Still to come: *control nobody
exercises* raising the controls none of the ten tests uses, and most of the 25 ungrouped gaps finding a feature.

## Part 2: new inputs

Ordered by cost. Each becomes an origin on nodes or edges (D2) and names the detectors it feeds.

**Already stored, not joined**

| Input | Adds | Feeds |
|---|---|---|
| Locator index and locator snapshots | control reach, operated vs checked | control nobody exercises, the check prior |
| `expect` steps and their matchers | an assertion map per page and control: visible-only, text, value, count | assertion-light, the check prior before any probe |
| Console errors, backend logs, background 5xx on passing runs | the app misbehaved and the test still passed | passed with errors |
| Function catalog (`test_functions`) | page-object methods per URL pattern | catalog method no test calls; cheaper drafts |
| CODEOWNERS | `owns` edges | gaps routed to a team; coverage per owner |
| Failure clusters and their fixing commits | escape history per file, not per scanned commit | exposure |
| Bug reports from the extension | escapes per page, with steps | escaped defect (already wired), exposure |

**One capture or setting change**

| Input | Adds | Feeds |
|---|---|---|
| Navigation list per test (Part 1) | page reach along the journey | single covering, reachable unvisited |
| ARIA snapshots on more states (after a dialog or menu opens) | controls the settle-time inventory misses | control nobody exercises |
| Front-end router manifest (Nuxt, Next, SvelteKit, React Router route lists) | declared **pages**, not only API routes | declared, never hit, for pages |
| OpenAPI `tags`, `operationId`, `x-owner` | feature and owner for declared routes | feature grouping, ownership |
| GraphQL operation names (from the request body's `operationName`, the name only) | one route node per operation instead of one `POST /graphql` hub | every route detector, for GraphQL apps |
| Feature-flag states per execution (OpenFeature hook, or the flag cookie or storage key in `page_state`) | which flag states the suite ran | the matrix detector |
| Response shapes ([`api-contract-drift.md`](api-contract-drift.md)) | the fields a route returns | field-level checks: a `drop-field` probe names a field nobody asserts |

**An integration a team already runs** (D6)

| Input | Adds | Feeds |
|---|---|---|
| Production route counts from the instrumentation packages, or an access-log summary upload | usage per route | exposure; *most used, least tested* |
| Error monitoring (Sentry, Datadog, OpenTelemetry error spans) grouped by route or transaction | real production failures per node | escape history; *fails in production, no test reaches it* |
| Tracker stories and acceptance criteria (the Jira binding) | intents per ticket | intent without a test; ticket coverage |
| Product analytics funnels (PostHog, Amplitude) | the top user journeys as page sequences | journey coverage: the share of the top journeys some test follows end to end |

**Research**

- Server-side coverage on the nightly job (`NODE_V8_COVERAGE` for Node, coverlet for .NET) as `file` nodes with
  origin `coverage`, the server half of code reach.
- Unit-level mutation reports (Stryker) imported per file, so a handler pseudo-tested end to end but protected by
  unit tests is not reported twice.

## Part 3: indicators

Two families. The first describes the suite; the second describes the map. Every indicator shows its denominator
and its origin (D3).

### How well the suite covers the application

| Indicator | Definition | Denominator known when |
|---|---|---|
| Declared surface reached | reached / declared routes and pages, per feature | a manifest, OpenAPI document or router manifest exists |
| Error paths exercised | documented non-2xx codes observed under test / documented codes | OpenAPI responses exist |
| Checked share | reached routes with a noticed probe / reached routes | always (probes are counted) |
| Not-noticed rate | not-noticed probes / applied probes | always; the first record's entry condition for server probes |
| Trusted redundancy | nodes by number of trusted tests: 0, 1, 2, 3 or more | always |
| Rendered elements operated | per page, operated / checked only / untested interactive elements | the page is rendered (the overlay's own numbers) |
| Assertion depth | per page, share of assertions that check a value, not visibility | always |
| Change coverage | changed files reached / changed files, per pull request, and the trend | an SCM diff exists |
| Uncovered changes acted on | uncovered files that gained a test in the same pull request / uncovered files | the first record's M1 success measure, not measured today |
| Exposure-weighted protection | Σ exposure × protection / Σ exposure over declared nodes | a declared surface exists |

### How far the map can be trusted

| Indicator | Definition | What a bad value means |
|---|---|---|
| Detector precision | for / (for + against) verdicts, per detector (shipped) | the detector is noisy on this project |
| Leave-one-test-out recall | remove one test's reach edges in memory, recompute, check that every node only it reached is raised | a detector misses what it exists to find |
| Benchmark precision and recall | the web-dashboard model labeled with ground truth: each node marked *visited mid-journey*, *sent by a click*, *only an untrusted test*; precision and recall per detector | a code change made the detectors worse |
| Reach agreement | for tests with code reach on: handler files a reached route maps to that the test also executed, and the reverse | the convention mapping is wrong for this framework |
| Convention hit rate | conventional handler files that exist at the run's ref | the file-routing convention does not apply |
| Map completeness | reached pages with an inventory, routes with a handler, controls with a reach decision, nodes with an owner | which setup step would wake which detector |
| Key cardinality | nodes added per run, per kind | an id leaking into keys, as the query does today |
| Probe inconclusive rate | inconclusive / probes, per fault and route | the plan targets requests that never fire |
| Escape lift | escapes (bug reports, tracker bugs, production errors) on nodes flagged as gaps / escapes on unflagged nodes, per node count | above one, gaps predict escapes; near one, the ranking is not worth its screen |
| Time to a decision | runs until a new node gets a reach decision | new surface stays unexamined |

Escape lift is the validity measure the first record asked for and never defined: the Google study it cites found
predictions alone change nothing, so the map has to show that what it flags is where defects land.

**A map health panel** on the Gaps tab lists the completeness numbers with the setup step behind each ("turn on
the page inventory: wakes three detectors"), the way the setup checklist lists capabilities.

**The benchmark** (shipped) extends `tests/unit/demo-test-map.test.ts`. The model labels its ground truth
(`expectedWebDashboardGaps`): what each test truly exercises, a test id the locator index cannot name included,
and the surface the application has; each detector's definition applied to that truth gives the gaps it should
raise. The test scores precision and recall per detector against `demo-test-map-benchmark.json`, and a change that
lowers a number fails until the fixture (`PIWI_UPDATE_DEMO_TEST_MAP=1`) and the labels say why. Before Part 1 it
would have read a precision of 0 of 8 for *API-only route*, the detector Part 1 retired. Today every detector
scores precision 1; the test-id click costs *control nobody exercises* three of its 24 gaps and *single covering
test* one of 24, since a control on a page where a test operated an unnamed element is not raised.

## Part 4: the extension

The Tested elements overlay (`apps/extension/src/content/coverage-overlay.ts`) evaluates the locator index on the
live page: operated, checked, untested and brittle, with *Copy locator* as its one action. It does not read the Test
Map, and its page keys were made equal to the map's precisely so the two could be joined
([`adr/locator-stability-and-pages.md`](../adr/locator-stability-and-pages.md)).

1. **Gaps on the page.** A read endpoint returns the Test Map slice of one page key: its gaps, its controls' reach,
   the routes it loads and their probe outcomes, the pages it links to and whether a test visits them. The overlay
   draws gap classes over its own boxes: a blind-spot control, a link to an unvisited page, a control whose request
   a probe broke unnoticed (through `triggers` edges, written for it), an element only an untrusted test reaches.
2. **Draft the missing test from the element.** An untested element gets *Record a test*: the extension's recorder
   starts from the gap's draft (the path from the nearest reached page, the catalog methods, the `piwi:` annotations),
   the assertion suggester proposes the check, and the result goes to the editor
   ([`record-from-the-ide.md`](record-from-the-ide.md)) or the clipboard. When the test lands, the gap closes and
   the verdict counts for its detector.
3. **The page as a source.** With consent per project, the overlay posts what the page shows when a person opens it:
   controls and links by role and accessible name, templated and capped as the page inventory is, under origin
   `explored`. Dialogs, menus, other roles and other data states then become surface the suite has never seen, marked
   *seen by a person, never by a test*. This is the first record's guided exploration with a person in the loop and
   no automation against the application.
4. **A probe by hand.** The DevTools panel already delays or fails a request on the tab (*Slow down or fail a
   request*). From a route in the slice, *Break it here* applies the probe's fault to that request and records what the
   page did: a screenshot and the console, filed as a resilience finding with the person's verdict.
5. **States and matrix.** The overlay counts elements in the DOM it sees; per page it can also list the states the
   tests reached (the locator index's `arrival` flags and pages) against the states the person opened, and filter
   the index by viewport, so *no test reaches the menu on mobile* shows where it happens.
6. **One rule for numbers.** The overlay's "41% of 34 interactive elements" is a percentage over a surface it fully
   sees. The map adopts the same rule (D3) and the overlay's numbers become the *rendered elements operated*
   indicator.

## Part 5: larger bets, each with an entry condition

| Bet | What it adds | Entry condition |
|---|---|---|
| Probe-validated generation | an agent drafts the test for a gap and keeps it only if it notices the probe the gap was about, the mutation-guided rule of the first record's reference 19 | Part 1 shipped and benchmark precision above 80 percent |
| Cross-project map | a dependency node in one project is a route node in another on the same instance; join them into a service-level map with contract coverage | two projects on one instance share a host in their spans |
| Release readiness per feature | exposure-weighted protection and its trend per feature, in the quality report | exposure is computed for node gaps (Part 1, item 6) |
| Redundancy, read backwards | nodes many trusted tests reach and every probe noticed: candidates for a smaller selection | the test-selection reach map reads the same edges |
| Named features for ungrouped surface | URL clustering with a proposed name, confirmed by a person | Part 1, item 5 leaves more than ten ungrouped nodes on a project |

## Delivery

1. Substrate, without new captures: items 1 to 4 and 8 to 10 of Part 1 (shipped), then 11, with the demo
   fixture regenerated.
2. Page files and age for node exposure, query-free route keys and their migration (items 6 and 7), with feature
   grouping and hubs (item 5, shipped).
3. The indicators of Part 3 and the map health panel, beside the labeled benchmark (shipped).
4. The extension's read slice and gap layer, then *Record a test* (Part 4, items 1 and 2).
5. The page as a source and the probe by hand (Part 4, items 3 and 4), behind a per-project opt-in.
6. Inputs of Part 2, cheapest first: OpenAPI tags, router manifests, GraphQL operations, then the integrations.

## Risks

- **More edges, more rows.** Page reach per navigation and control reach multiply `reaches` edges by the journey
  length. The size rules of the first record (pattern keys, templated names, caps) apply unchanged; the key
  cardinality indicator watches them.
- **Locator-to-control mapping is heuristic.** A CSS chain resolves through a snapshot of one execution; the edge
  carries that origin and a confidence, and *control nobody exercises* reads only confident edges.
- **Explored surface can be personal.** Role and accessible name only, templated, never values; the same rule the
  page inventory follows, and off unless a project turns it on.
- **Indicators invite targets.** A percentage over a declared surface becomes a goal. Each indicator shows its
  denominator, and none feeds a gate.

## Open questions

1. Is the hub threshold a share of tests, a share of features, or both?
2. Does explored surface count toward *declared, never hit*, or only toward its own detector?
3. Where does escape lift live: per project on the Gaps tab, or per instance on the admin page next to precision?
4. Should the benchmark labels live in the model module, or in a separate fixture a contributor can extend?

## Not in this plan

- Line or branch coverage of any kind as a headline number.
- Automatic test generation without a person or an agent reviewing the draft.
- Production probes of any level.
