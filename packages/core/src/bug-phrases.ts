/**
 * The words a bug report is written with, one phrasebook per language: the
 * steps in plain words, what should happen, the evidence summary and the
 * Markdown report's headings and labels.
 *
 * `bug-report.ts` reads a step into language-free parts (a {@link BugSubject},
 * a {@link BugStepValue}, a {@link BugExpectation}) and a phrasebook turns them
 * into a sentence. A flat list of messages cannot do that: French articles
 * agree with the noun and elide before a vowel, so each language writes its own
 * templates around its own role nouns. Page texts, locators and test ids reach
 * a phrasebook as they are and come out quoted, never translated.
