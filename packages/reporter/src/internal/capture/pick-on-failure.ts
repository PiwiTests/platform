/**
 * Failure-time locator picker: when enabled (opt-in via the
 * `pickLocatorOnFailure` reporter option / `PIWI_PICK_LOCATOR_ON_FAIL`), a
 * test whose locator action failed gets a picker overlay injected into the
 * still-open page. The flow is guided:
 *
 *  1. **Element** — hover highlights, a click picks. The pick snaps to the
 *     nearest actionable ancestor (a click on the `<span>` inside a button
 *     picks the button), and ↑/↓ walk the DOM tree before the click commits.
 *  2. **Anchors** — the element's ancestors are listed; the human can bless
 *     one or more *stable parents* to scope the locator to, with a live
 *     "matches N" count for the current selection against the failing page.
 *  3. **Confirm** — ranked replacement locators (standard generation merged
 *     with the anchor-scoped candidates) are listed; the human confirms one.
 *
 * The confirmed pick is folded into the failing call site's locator snapshot
 * (so it rides the normal `piwi-locators` wire into the dashboard's healing
 * panel) and attached as `piwi-user-pick` plus a report annotation.
 *
 * Gated exactly like failure-time inspection (`inspect-on-failure.ts`):
 * headed browser, never CI, final attempt only.
 *
 * The overlay steps themselves (`installPickerOverlay`, `showAnchorPicker`,
 * `showPickerChoices`) and the anchor-alternative math live in
 * `@piwitests/picker-dom`, shared with the dashboard's snapshot picker.
 * Re-exported here so existing importers keep importing them from this module.
