 *    shedding them loses nothing final.
 *  - `begin` (tier 1) marks a test as started; the server can still create the
 *    case from the `complete` that follows, so it is shed after steps.
 *  - `complete` (tier 2) carries the test's result and detail. Shedding it is
 *    real *live* data loss, so it happens only as a last resort — and the
 *    reporter's own `CollectedTestCase` set still holds the full run for the
