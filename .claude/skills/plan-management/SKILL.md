# Plan Management

This skill covers the end-to-end workflow for managing implementation plans in the Piwi Dashboard project. Plans live
in `plans/` (local, gitignored). `plans/README.md` describes the layout; `plans/roadmap.md` is the single source of
truth for internal priorities; the committed `ROADMAP.md` is the public direction and the committed `proposals/` hold
design records that often ship without touching `plans/`.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `plans/roadmap.md` | Ranked **Build next** table · **Quick fixes** · **Active plans** / **Parked plans** tables · **Later** (one-liners by theme) · **Strategy notes** |
| `plans/shipped.md` | The shipped ledger (newest block first) + the **Archived plans** index |
| `plans/exploration-findings.md` | **Open** findings (re-verified each audit) + **Resolved** log |
| `plans/rejected-ideas.md` | Ideas set aside on purpose, each with the reason |
| `plans/active/` | Plans with open work that is next |
| `plans/later/` | Parked plans |
| `plans/research/` | Benchmarks / audits whose sections serve as specs until a plan is opened |
| `plans/archive/` | Shipped or closed plans; each starts with an "Archived <date>" note naming where any remainder went |
| `proposals/` (committed) | Design records — **always check them during an audit**; mirror their status into `plans/` |

## When to Use

- User asks to "update the X plan" or "check progress on X plan"
- User asks to "archive" or "mark as shipped" a plan
- User asks to update the roadmap, or "what should we build next"
- User asks to add/remove items from a plan's checklist
- After implementing features from a plan — sync its status

## Workflow

### 1. Read the plan and assess its state

Read `plans/active/<name>.md` (or `later/`). If the plan mirrors a proposal, read the proposal's **Status** paragraph
too. If the plan has a "File-by-file checklist" or numbered checklist sections, those are the items to check.

For each checklist item, search the codebase to determine whether it's been implemented:

```bash
# Check if specified files exist
Test-Path "<path>"
# Search for key symbols introduced by the plan
rg "<symbol>" --include "*.ts" --include "*.vue" apps/application/ packages/reporter/
# Check type definitions, schema, API handlers, UI components, demo mirror, tests
```

Do NOT use `Get-ChildItem` for file existence — use `Test-Path` or `glob`/`grep` tools. Also read `CHANGELOG.md` for
the releases since the plan's last dated status — features often land from a proposal or a fix without a plan edit.

### 2. Determine plan status

A plan is **fully shipped** when ALL checklist items are confirmed implemented (or the remainder is deliberately
dropped). A plan is **partially shipped** when some sections are done and others remain.

### 3. If fully shipped — archive it

```powershell
Move-Item -LiteralPath "plans\active\<name>.md" -Destination "plans\archive\<name>.md"
```

Then:

1. Prepend an `> **Archived YYYY-MM-DD.**` blockquote under the title that names where any remainder now lives
   (roadmap quick fix, another plan, or `rejected-ideas.md`), and fix relative links (`../active/...`,
   `../rejected-ideas.md`, same-folder archive links).
2. `plans/shipped.md` → add a row in the newest block **and** a row in "Archived plans".
3. `plans/roadmap.md` → remove the row from *Active plans* / *Parked plans*; drop or update its *Build next* entry.
4. Anything dropped on purpose → a numbered entry in `plans/rejected-ideas.md` with the reason.

### 4. If partially shipped — update the plan in place

- Mark completed items `[x]` (or ✅) with dates where the plan uses them (e.g. `✅ shipped 2026-07-01`).
- Update the dated **Status** block under the title (bump the date, one bullet per change).
- Update the plan's row in the roadmap's *Active plans* / *Parked plans* table and, if it moved, the *Build next* table.
- If the unshipped remainder should be parked, move the file to `plans/later/` and the row to *Parked plans*.

### 5. Roadmap conventions (`plans/roadmap.md`)

- **Build next**: a ranked table (`#`, What, Why now, Effort S/M/L, Where the spec is). Keep it to ~8 rows; every row
  links a plan, a proposal, or a `research/` section.
- **Quick fixes**: small verified-open items, each traceable to a finding in `exploration-findings.md`.
- **Active plans** / **Parked plans**: one row per file in `active/` and `later/`; committed proposals with an open
  remainder are listed under *Active plans* in their own table.
- **Later**: one-liners grouped by theme, no checklists. Items graduate to *Build next* by getting a plan or a spec link.
- Never restate counts the code defines (MCP tool count, route count) — point at the registry instead.
- Bump the **Last updated** line and summarize what shipped since, in one paragraph.

### 6. Capture findings

Append bugs, inconsistencies or tech debt found during the assessment to `plans/exploration-findings.md` under
**Open**, using the template at the top of that file; move fixed findings to **Resolved** with the date (one line each).

### 7. Start a plan from a *Build next* item

Create `plans/active/<name>.md` from the linked spec with the structure below, then add its row to *Active plans*.

### 8. No commit needed

Plans are gitignored (`plans/` is in `.gitignore`) — they're local working documents. Do not commit plan changes or the
archive move. (This skill file and `AGENTS.md` are committed; edit them only when the workflow itself changes.)

## Plan Structure Conventions

- **Goal** at the top (one-line summary) and a dated **Status** block right under the title
- **Current state** (findings/audit of what exists)
- **Decisions** (D1, D2, … table of architectural choices)
- **Workstreams** (numbered, each with sub-items like A1, A2, B1, B2, …)
- **File-by-file checklist** at the end (checkboxes grouped by workstream)
- **Verification steps** (numbered task list for manual QA)
- **Risks & notes**
