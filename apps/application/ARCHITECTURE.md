# Dashboard app — architecture map

Reference for `apps/application/`: what exists and where. The **rules** for changing it live in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — read that before editing.

This map describes structure and intent, not every file. Directory listings and the auto-generated
[`/_openapi.json`](#backend) are the authority on exact names.

## Shape

```
app/          Vue 4 SPA/SSR front end — pages, components, composables, utils, layouts
server/       Nitro back end — api/, routes/, utils/, database/, middleware/, tasks/
shared/       Types, constants, pure helpers shared by app + server + demo (`#shared/...`)
app/demo/     In-browser mirror of the server for the demo SPA
scripts/      Seed generation, demo media capture, DB query helper, the performance suite (`scripts/perf/`)
tests/        Playwright specs (`*.spec.ts`) + Vitest unit tests (`tests/unit/*.test.ts`)
types/        Front-end API response types (`api.ts`)
```

## Shared types & core

- `shared/types.ts` — the **wire contract**: `TestCasePayload`, `StreamEventPayload`, `TestRunSubmitPayload`,
  `TestRunFinishPayload` and the `TestRunStatus` / `TestCaseStatus` unions. Server endpoints import it directly via
  `#shared/types`.
- `shared/permissions.ts` holds the **authorization model**: `InstanceRole`, `ProjectRole`, `Permission`, the matrix
  `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`, a user's `AccessSummary` and the checks on it (`can`, `passesEarlyCheck`, `projectScopeFor`).
  Pure, imported by the server, the MCP tools, the demo and `useAuth`.
- `shared/project-run-scope.ts` is the **project run scope**: the runs a project page's filters pick (environments,
  branches, the branch policy, full runs only), its query keys (the analytics ones) and the in-browser matcher;
  `shared/handlers/project-run-scope.ts` turns it into the SQL every project tab's handler adds.
- The small wire **leaf shapes** (`BrowserConfig`, `TestStepEvent`, `SuiteConfigEntry`, `TestAnnotation`,
  `FilterDetails`, `TestSourceFrame`) live in `@piwitests/core/wire` and are re-exported here — one source of truth
  shared with the reporter. Per-case payloads stay app-side; the reporter's `WireTestCase` stays reporter-side. The two
  are kept compatible by `tests/unit/wire-shared-drift.test.ts`.
- `@piwitests/core` (`packages/core/`) is a private, **zero-dependency**, browser/worker/server-safe package holding
  pure cross-cutting logic: locator generation/scoring, ARIA parsing + element-match healing, locator-healing types, the
  wire leaves, and the locator-method list. It ships **TypeScript source** (no build step) — Vite/Vitest transpile it,
  the reporter's tsup inlines it. The app consumes it through thin `shared/*` re-export shims.

## Database

Drizzle ORM over **SQLite (libSQL)** or **PostgreSQL (postgres.js)**, chosen at runtime by `PIWI_DATABASE_URL`.

- `server/database/schema.sqlite.ts` and `schema.pg.ts` — the real schemas (edit both).
- `server/database/schema.ts` — a conditional re-export that picks a dialect at module init; type-checking uses the
  SQLite schema as canonical. Never edit it to add tables.
- `server/database/migrations/` (SQLite) and `migrations-pg/` (PostgreSQL, auto-run on startup).
- `server/database/migration-history.ts` — the startup check of the recorded migration history, and the repair of a
  database that ran another branch's migrations; `migration-targets.ts` holds its SQLite and PostgreSQL queries.

Tables, by area:

| Area               | Tables                                                                                                                        |

| Core results       | `projects`, `test_runs`, `test_suites`, `test_cases`, `test_runs_cases`, `network_requests`                                   |
| Failure analysis   | `failure_clusters`, `failure_cluster_aliases`, `cluster_merge_suggestions`, `failure_diagnoses`, `failure_diagnosis_versions` |
| Evidence & storage | `files`, `trace_resources`, `trace_blobs`, `case_payloads`, `locator_snapshots`, `locator_usages`                             |
| Metadata           | `tags`, `project_tags`, `markers`, `entity_links`, `app_settings`, `test_functions`, `test_selections`                        |

| Notifications      | `notification_channels`, `subscriptions`, `notification_deliveries`                                                           |
| Analytics          | `analytics_daily_rollups`, `analytics_dashboards`, `report_schedules`, `report_snapshots`                                     |
| Resources          | `test_run_resource_reports`, `resource_findings`, `resource_occurrences`                                                      |

Non-obvious ones:

- **`case_payloads`** — content-addressed storage for large per-execution text (`aria_snapshot`, `test_source`,
  `test_source_frames`): one row per unique content per project (SHA-256 `hash`, unique `(project_id, hash)`),
  referenced from `test_runs_cases.*_payload_id`. See the rule in `AGENTS.md`.
- **`locator_snapshots`** — one row per locator call site (`test_case_id` + `location`), upserted each run with the
  latest element attributes and pre-computed ranked alternatives. Unique index on `(test_case_id, location)`;
  `last_seen_run_id` FK is `ON DELETE set null`.
- **`locator_usages`** — the locator index: one row per (test case, Playwright project, branch, call site, action,
  canonical chain, page), read from the steps of each ingested execution; `branch` is `''` for the default branch, and a
  view of another branch replaces the default rows of the tests that ran on it. `page` is the page key the call ran
  on, joined by call site and chain from the execution's `piwi-locator-pages` list (stored through `case_payloads` as
  `test_runs_cases.locator_pages_payload_id`, so a rebuild keeps it; `server/utils/locator-pages.ts`), `''` when
  unknown; `arrival` says a call ran there before any locator interaction. Feeds "Who uses this?", the project's
  Locators page and the extension's Tested elements (`GET /api/projects/:id/locator-index`).
- **`account_tokens`** — single-use SHA-256-hashed tokens for reset/invite/verify, with a purpose enum and TTL enforced
  at query time.
- **`notification_deliveries`** — an outbox: `dedupeKey` unique for idempotency, `status`, `attempts` + `scheduledFor`
  for progressive retry (1/5/15/60/240 min).
- **`resource_findings`** — one row per project and finding identity (`shared/resource-fingerprint.mjs`: verdict,
  kind, scope and where it was opened, line included), with the runs it was first and last seen in, ordered by start
  time; `resource_occurrences` holds each run's showing with the run's branch. Written on finalize by
  `shared/handlers/resource-findings.ts`, which also fixes a finding after five clean full runs of the default branch,
  moves a finding to its new line when an edit above it shifted it (the same identity without line numbers, closest
  line first), and tells the gate and the pull-request comment which findings are new to the base branch.
- **`test_run_resource_reports`** — one row per run and shard with that reporter's resource report, upserted whole by
  its finish so concurrent shards never overwrite each other; read folded in shard order
  (`shared/handlers/resource-reports.ts`).
- **`entity_links`** — external URLs (Jira, GitHub…) attached to a run, execution or test case via three nullable FK
  columns with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, mirroring the `files` pattern. Provider auto-detected by `shared/link-detect.ts`.

## Backend

Nitro file-based routing under `server/api/`, plus `server/routes/` for non-`/api` routes. The auto-generated
**OpenAPI 3.1** spec at `/_openapi.json` and the in-app reference at `/docs` are the authoritative endpoint list — this
is only the shape of it.

Import orchestration is shared, not mirrored: `shared/handlers/import-runs.ts` owns everything after parsing, with
the server and demo supplying an `ImportPort` for the parts that genuinely differ.

Offline export follows the same split: `shared/export/` collects the bundle, renders the self-contained HTML and
Markdown, and writes the ZIP (fflate, so it runs in the demo's service worker too); server and demo differ only in the
`ExportAssetReader` that fetches evidence bytes. `server/utils/trace-zip.ts` is unrelated — it stores rather than
deflates and exists for trace-blob reconstruction.

function catalog — add by hand, via AI extraction from pasted code, or — with no AI configured — copy a prompt for
your own AI chat and paste its reply back in) · `/projects/[id]/selections` (test selections — builder with live
preview and the runnable command) · `/test-runs/[id]` · `/test-cases/[id]` (stable
case across runs) · `/test-run-cases/[id]` (one execution) · `/failure-clusters/[id]` · `/analytics` (the viewer's default dashboard) + `/analytics/d/[id]` (one dashboard, `?tv=1` for TV mode) + `/analytics/dashboards` · `/settings/*` ·
`/docs` (in-app API reference) · `/mcp` · `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` (public, layout-free).

**Failure pages.** `/test-run-cases/[id]` (one execution) and `/failure-clusters/[id]` read top to bottom in one
column. Both open on `SituationBlock`: an identity kicker, the headline as the page's `h1`, then labelled rows in the
order of `SITUATION_ROWS` (`app/utils/situation-rows.ts`), the explanation, then the action, then the context (Most
likely `StoryLine`, Situation, State `ClusterStateLine`, Next `NextStepLine`, Cluster, Issue `IssueLine`,
Occurrences, What changed `WhatChangedLine`, The suite; a page fills the rows it has) and a facts line
(`ExecutionFactsLine`, `ClusterFactsLine`) holding Details and Raw error. On the execution page a meta line under the
headline (`ExecutionMetaLine`) says since when it fails, on which commit, and whether a newer execution of the test
failed again or passed, and the Cluster row names the cluster, then its ticket (`SituationParts` in the lead of
`IssueLine`); the cluster page has an Issue row instead. The rows are built in the handlers the demo shares
(`shared/handlers/test-cases.ts`, `shared/handlers/failure-clusters.ts`) from `shared/situation.ts` (with
`shared/latest-execution.ts` over `getNewerExecutions`), `shared/cluster-state.ts` and `computeNextStep`
(`shared/next-step.ts`); `useNextStepActions` turns the Next row's action id into behavior on both pages. Both pages choose Most likely
and word where the Next step's change comes from with `shared/most-likely.ts` (`pickMostLikely`,
`nextStepSourceLine`), one rule for the two. Under the block, the execution page shows `DidNotRunCard` for a test that did not run, `EvidenceTabs` (opening on the tab
`useEvidenceHint` picks from the leading clue), the `Toolbox` (More ways to fix: one folded section per way to fix, the
one the next step points at open) and History (`HistoryStrip`). The cluster page shows the section the next step points
at as a card of its own (`Toolbox` with `lead`; the sections, their order and the step each serves are in
`app/utils/fix-sections.ts`), then `ClusterInvestigation` when there is a diff to browse, `ClusterAffectedTests` (its
selection picks the execution the evidence shows, with several tests), `EvidenceTabs`, More ways to fix with the other
sections folded, then the history, folded to one line each: `ClusterOccurrenceTrend` (a `ChartCard` with `foldKey`,
opened by the occurrence sparkline) and `ClusterActivity`. Both
pages provide a section locator (`clusterSectionLocatorKey`) so a clue or an AI citation reveals the evidence it cites.
`/bug-reports/[id]` opens on the same block with Situation, State, Next and The suite. `npm run app:measure` holds the
two failure pages to their budgets (text styles, controls above the fold, the Next step beside what it copies).

### Components (`app/components/`)

Domain subfolders, all auto-imported **without a folder prefix** (`pathPrefix: false`), so names are globally unique:

Shared building blocks worth knowing before writing new markup (`AGENTS.md` makes reuse a rule):

- **Structure** — `SectionCard` (standard icon/title/count/subtitle header, `actions` + `footer` slots),
  `CollapsibleSectionCard` (same contract + required `storageKey`, cookie-persisted fold state via `useFoldedState`,
  `#folded` peek slot), `FoldableSummary`, `DetailPageLayout` (summary + tabs + panels with correct flex height at `lg`+,
  single-document scroll below).
- **States** — `EmptyState`, `LoadingState`, `ErrorState` (with an `action` slot).
- **Connection requests** — `ConnectRequestCard` (the logo-and-card page, with its loading and error states) and
  `ConnectRequestButtons` (Deny / Allow), driven by `useConnectRequest`: the page a signed-in user answers a client's
  request on, Piwi Picker's and the editors' (`/extension/connect`) and an MCP client's OAuth sign-in (`/oauth/consent`).
- **Filters** — `FiltersBlock` (the bordered _Filters_ block every page's filters sit in, folding to a summary on a
  phone), `FilterBar` (environment, branch, branch policy via `BranchPolicySelect`, full runs only) and
  `HiddenRunsNote` (what the filters hide, with the action that shows it).
- **Data display** — `StatTile` + `StatTileGrid` (auto-fitting, no per-page breakpoints), `TableScroller`,
  `FilterToolbar`, `ChartCard` (header + `legend`; `foldKey` folds it to one line), the SVG chart primitives `ChartFrame` (self-measuring plot area,
  y-axis) / `ChartTooltip` / `ChartMarkerLines` / `ChartLegend` / `ChartMarkerTooltip`, `MiniRunBars`,
  `DurationValue` (tight `210ms` via
  the pure `splitDuration`), `CodeBlock`, `MarkdownPreview`, `DiffPatch` / `DiffFile`, `LocatorCode` (a locator
  expression syntax-highlighted through `@piwitests/picker-dom`'s `tokenizeLocator`), `ErrorText` (error text with
  its ANSI colors rendered — a one-line `line` preview for lists and cells, or the full `block`), `DeferredTooltip`
  (a `UTooltip` built on the pointer's first entry, for a tooltip repeated on every row of a list).
- **Test lists** — `TestRow` + `TestRowGroup` (one test or group header, read the same in every list),
  `TestSearchInput` (the search box of the run and project Tests tabs: qualifiers, completion of the term under the
  caret, Ctrl+F through `useFindShortcut`) and `SearchHighlight` (marks what a search matched). The language lives in
  `shared/test-search.ts` — parser, in-memory matcher, highlight ranges, completion — with its SQL form in
  `shared/utils/test-search-sql.ts` for the paged catalog; run and file order and the File / File + Describe rows in
  `app/utils/test-list-order.ts`.
- **Navigation & actions** — `NavbarActions` (every `UDashboardNavbar` `#right` group; labels collapse to icons below
  `xl`), `BreadcrumbNav` (drop-in for `UBreadcrumb` and the page title of every detail page — the navbar never
  repeats it; only the current crumb truncates, middle levels hide below `2xl`, ancestors collapse into a dropdown
  below `sm`), `OpenInIdeLink` +
  `OpenInIdeSettingsModal`, `DocLink`, `LinkChip` / `EntityLinks`.
- **Help & settings** — `HelpHint` (topic keys from `app/utils/help-content.ts`), `SettingsField`, `EnvManagedBadge`,
  `EnvManagedAlert`.
- **Domain widgets** — `RunStatusBadge`, `StatusChip` (status icon + label in one badge, for detail summaries),
  `TestStatusBar`, `TagBadge` / `TagsSelect`, `BrowserBadge`, `MarkerBadge` / `MarkerFormModal`,
  `ZoomableImage` (a click / keyboard-accessible image with a hover "Enlarge" affordance) driving
  `ScreenshotLightbox` (full-screen, keyboard-navigable, with an actual-size zoom toggle for large captures and a
  details panel naming the test, the step and the error raised on the page — `LightboxImage` in
  `app/utils/lightbox.ts`),
  `VideoPlayer`, `TraceListItem`, `LocatorHealingPanel` / `LocatorAlternativeRow`,
  `SnapshotLocatorPicker`, `EnvironmentDiffCard`, `DataLocationCard`.
- **Failure pages** — `SituationBlock` (the labelled block the failure pages and a bug report open on: its rows in
  `SITUATION_ROWS`, the status color on its left edge), `FailureHeadline` (the one-line headline, its locator in a chip when it
  is the `h1`), `StatusChip` in the block's identity kicker, `StoryLine` (Most likely), `NextStepLine` (the one
  recommended step, its actions emitted as ids the page handles through `useNextStepActions`), `Toolbox` (More ways
  to fix, one folded section per way) and `HistoryStrip` (this test's recent executions as a row of squares).

### Composables & utils

`app/composables/` covers cross-component state and behaviour — auth and dashboard shell, run streaming
(`useRunStream`, `useNotificationStream`), diagnosis (`useClusterDiagnosis`, `useStreamingDiagnosis`,
`useDiagnosisNotification`), timeline (`useTimelineModel`, `useTimelineViewport`), fold/tree state
(`useFoldedState`, `useFoldableSummary`, `useTreeViewCookie`), settings derivation (`useSettingsNav`,
`useSettingsEnvState`), analytics scope, the run page's retry command (`useRunRetryCommand` — one failing set and one
shared mode for every copy button on the page), IDE preferences (`useOpenInIde`), desktop detection (`useIsDesktop`,
`useTauri`), demo helpers, and small utilities (`useCopy` / `useCopyRich` — use these instead of hand-rolling
`navigator.clipboard`, `useAiStatus`, `useChartTooltip`).

`app/utils/` holds pure helpers: `index.ts` (`formatDuration`, `splitDuration`, `getStatusColor`, `getFileApiPath`,
`formatRelativeTime`, `createSortHeader`, `formatBytes`, `errorMessage`, patch/commit helpers, cluster colour maps),
`performance-hints.ts`, `ide-links.ts`, `help-content.ts`, `settings-metadata.ts`, `openapi.ts` / `openapi-console.ts`,
`status-palette.ts` (`STATUS_PALETTE` / `statusPalette` — the test outcome colors every bar, chart, history cell,
timeline bar and filter chip uses, backed by the `--color-status-*` tokens in `assets/css/main.css`), `pass-rate.ts`
(the one threshold set and color scale for every colored pass rate, heatmap cells included), `duration-tone.ts` (the
one tone of a timeline duration that stands out in its test, by the rule of
`shared/duration-standout.ts`: at least 1 s and a third of the test), `chart.ts` (the
per-chart series definitions the plots and their legends share, and the tick/stack/bar geometry behind the SVG
charts). `retry-command.ts` (`buildRetryCommand` — `file-line` / `grep` / `file` modes,
shell-escaped, capped at 4096 chars; `buildTitleGrepFlag` — the regex-escaped, shell-quoted `-g` flag the fix plan and
auto-heal verify commands add) and `locator-edit.ts` (`buildLocatorEdit` — rewrite the failing locator call on a
source line) now live in `shared/` so the server and demo share them (the fix plan builds the same verify command and
edits); thin `app/utils/` re-export shims keep them auto-imported. Locator-line edits become a git-applyable unified
diff via `shared/heal-edit.ts` (`buildHealEdit` / `buildUnifiedLineDiff`), and `shared/callsite-location.ts`
(`parseCallsiteLocation`) parses a captured `file:line:col` (drive-letter-safe).

## Demo SPA

`PIWI_DEMO_MODE=true` builds a client-only SPA: a PWA service worker (`app/service-worker/demo-sw.ts`) intercepts
`/api/` and serves it from in-browser sql.js (WASM SQLite) through Drizzle, persisted in IndexedDB. `app/demo/api/router.ts`
dispatches to per-domain handlers that mirror the server; `app/demo/db.client.ts` is shared by SW and main thread.
Live updates use a BroadcastChannel instead of SSE. Rules and invariants: see `AGENTS.md`.
