      'A quarantined test still runs and still reports — it is excluded from the CI gate’s verdict and nothing else. That is what makes the exit ramp work: `consecutivePasses` counts passing runs since quarantine, and `releaseProposed` turns true once a test has earned its way out. `debt` aggregates the cost of the list so it cannot quietly grow forever. `candidates` proposes tests worth quarantining, ranked by the CI time their flakiness wastes; each lists its `reasons`, and a completed AI diagnosis calling the test flaky with high confidence (not rated unhelpful) adds one, named in `diagnosis`. A dismissed proposal stays listed: `releaseDismissed` marks an entry whose proposed release was dismissed, and `dismissed` a candidate dismissed since the newest run (`POST /api/projects/:id/quarantine/:testCaseId/dismiss`). Set `?candidates=false` to skip that computation.',
