      "Returns what a run's reporters measured about resources: `report.parts`, one per reporter (one per shard of a sharded run), each with the findings (objects left open past the test or describe block that opened them, pages opened and never used, pages, listeners or route handlers piling up on a long-lived page, Node handles left in a worker, and probable leaks counted from steps) and what the run cost its machine (CPU by process role, time waiting for a CPU, peak memory, disk); and `costliest`, the executions that used the most CPU in their worker and browser processes, at most 20, with `measuredExecutions` counting every execution that carried its cost. `history` holds each finding's place in the project's history, keyed by its identity (verdict, kind, scope and where it was opened, line included): `isNew` when no earlier run of `baseBranch` (the pull request's target, else the default branch) showed it, under this identity or the one it had before an edit above its line moved it, the run it was first seen in, the runs that showed it, and `reopened` when it had been fixed. `report` is null when no reporter sent one, or when the project declined the resources capability.",
