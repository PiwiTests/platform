/**
 * Effective test ownership: who answers for a failing test.
 *
 * Two sources, in priority order:
 *
 * 1. A `piwi:owner` annotation on the test — explicit, and always wins.
 * 2. The repository's CODEOWNERS, matched against the spec's file path.
 *
 * The second is the point. Asking every team to annotate every test is how
 * ownership features die; the repository already records who owns which files,
 * and Piwi can read it because it runs inside the network with an SCM token it
 * already has. That makes ownership work on day one with zero test edits.
 *
 * Resolution happens at read time against a short TTL cache rather than being
 * stored on the test case. CODEOWNERS changes without any test changing, so a
 * persisted copy would be wrong until the next run reported that spec.
