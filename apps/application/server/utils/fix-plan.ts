/**
 * A fix plan — everything an agent needs to repair one failure cluster, in a
 * single answer.
 *
 * The parts already existed and were scattered across four tools: the
 * diagnosis, the validated patch, the ranked locator replacement, the failing
 * tests, the source line to edit. An agent asking four questions and stitching
 * the answers together gets a worse result than one that is handed the plan.
 *
 * The last field is the one that matters most. `verify` tells the agent exactly
 * which command proves the work, and that Piwi will record the cluster as fixed
 * when those tests pass — so the loop closes without a human deciding whether
 * it worked.
 *
 * Nothing here leaves the machine it runs on: the dashboard is self-hosted, the
 * model is whatever the operator configured, and the patch was validated
 * against their own source. That is the whole point of doing this locally.
