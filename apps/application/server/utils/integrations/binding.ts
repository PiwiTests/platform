/**
 * Read and write a project's tracker binding as a resolved settings object. The
 * table keeps the binding in typed columns (project key, issue type, labels …)
 * plus three JSON blobs (include toggles, policies, owner routes, auto-create);
 * this maps between those columns and the flat {@link ResolvedProjectIntegration}
 * the settings endpoint and the create-issue draft both read.
 *
 * A project has at most one binding here — the endpoint replaces it whole, so a
 * connection change never leaves a second, stale row behind.
