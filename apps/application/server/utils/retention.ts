 * gone, so a blob shared by several deleted rows (or by another run) is counted
 * correctly — a per-row refcount taken before deletion sees the not-yet-deleted
 * siblings and leaks the blob.
 *
 * The daily rollups follow in the transaction that deletes the run rows: the
 * retained rows of the touched days are recomputed from the runs that stay.
 * With `archiveRollups` (age-based deletion) the deleted runs' numbers are
