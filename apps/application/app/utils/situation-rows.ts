/**
 * The labelled lines of the situation block, in the order the block renders
 * them: the explanation first, then the action, then the context.
 *
 * - **Explanation**: _Most likely_ (the story or the diagnosis) and _Situation_
 *   (since when and where it fails, or the claim a bug report makes).
 * - **Action**: _State_ sits right above _Next_, since the state often says why
 *   the next step is the one offered.
 * - **Context**: the ticket (_Issue_), then the facts that help read the failure
 *   (_Occurrences_, _What changed_, _The suite_).
 *
 * Every page fills only the lines it has, so one order serves the execution
 * page (Most likely, Situation, Next, Issue), the cluster page (Most likely,
 * State, Next, Issue, Occurrences, What changed) and a bug report (Situation,
 * State, Next, The suite).
