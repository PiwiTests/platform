/**
 * The labelled lines of the situation block, in the order the block renders
 * them: the explanation first, then the action, then the context.
 *
 * - **Explanation**: _Most likely_ (the story or the diagnosis) and _Situation_
 *   (the claim a bug report makes).
 * - **Action**: _State_ sits right above _Next_, since the state often says why
 *   the next step is the one offered.
 * - **Context**: the failure's cluster and its ticket first (_Cluster_ on the
 *   execution page, which ends with the ticket; _Issue_ on the cluster page),
 *   then the facts that help read the failure (_Occurrences_, _What changed_,
 *   _The suite_).
 *
 * Every page fills only the lines it has, so one order serves the execution
 * page (Most likely, Next, Cluster), the cluster page (Most likely, State,
 * Next, Issue, Occurrences, What changed) and a bug report (Situation, State,
 * Next, The suite).
