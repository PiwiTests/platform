/**
 * The resolved instance-level state of every optional capability.
 *
 * Backed by `useAsyncData` keyed `capabilities-instance`, so the states are
 * fetched during SSR and hydrated from the payload rather than fetched only on
 * the client. It is async: `await` it at the top of `<script setup>` (as
 * `SubscribeBell.vue` does with `useFetch`), which resolves under the page's
 * Suspense boundary so a declined capability's chrome is absent from the first
 * render instead of flashing in and disappearing after hydration. Repeated calls
 * share one fetch through the key.
 *
 * `state(id)` is the resolved state, `isHidden(id)` is true when a capability is
 * declined or not applicable (so a surface renders nothing), `canDecide` gates
 * the decline controls to administrators, `decide` writes one decision and
 * `decideMany` writes several at once (`null` clears a decision). A read failure
 * resolves to an empty list.
