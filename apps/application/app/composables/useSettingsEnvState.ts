/**
 * Resolves which settings pages are currently "env-managed" (one or more of
 * their fields pinned by a `PIWI_*` env var), so the settings nav can show a
 * lock badge and pages can show the standardized banner.
 *
 * Reuses the existing `GET /api/settings/*` endpoints — no new server API. The
 * AI page is env-managed when its provider is env-pinned (`AiSettings.envManaged`);
 * SMTP is always env-only (read-only display); the Performance page when its
 * wasted-wait patterns or its cost of a CI minute come from env. Pages with no env-overridable fields
 * (account, users, tags) are never env-managed. Storage backend is env-only by
 * design but no endpoint
 * reports it today, so it is treated as "overridable but not necessarily locked"
 * (the page shows the env-var reference card regardless).
 *
 * Fetches lazily and only on the client (these endpoints are admin-gated; in
 * demo mode they are served by the service worker).
