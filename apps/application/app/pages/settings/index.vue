 * `/settings` has no content of its own — it redirects to the first settings
 * page the current user can actually see.
 *
 * It used to render a "General settings" card whose entire body told you to
 * click something in the sidebar, which made the first click into Settings a
 * dead end. The target is computed from the same nav registry rather than
 * hardcoded, because "the first page" differs by role and build: a web instance
 * lands on Account (admin or not), while the desktop build — single-user, auth
 * off, account pages hidden — lands on Notifications.
 *
 * The redirect is issued synchronously in setup so it also happens during SSR
 * (a real redirect response rather than a flash of this page). `useSettingsNav`
 * is a pure computed over the static registry plus auth state, so reading it
 * here needs no await. The template is only what a client sees in the gap
 * before navigation commits.
