 * "More ways to fix" — every other way to fix, verify or reproduce a failure,
 * placed after the Evidence card. Each section is folded to one line (a
 * sentence-case label plus a one-line summary the page supplies) except the one
 * the next step points at, which opens with the page. A folded section's body is
 * not rendered, so its code blocks never count against the first screen. The
 * `FixSectionKey` union (`app/utils/fix-sections.ts`) and the per-section slot
 * contract are the same the two pages fill; the card renders the sections it is
 * given in one fixed order.
 *
 * With `lead`, the section the next step points at is not a fold of the card: it
 * is a card of its own, titled with the section's label and always open, followed
 * by the `between` slot (what the page shows between the fix and the rest), then
 * "More ways to fix" with every other section folded. Without a section for the
 * next step, `lead` renders the `between` slot, then the card.
