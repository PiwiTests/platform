/**
 * Client-side implementations of the AI-diagnosis endpoints for demo mode.
 *
 * The demo has no real AI provider, but it still tells a fully-grounded story: for
 * every failing cluster it generates a diagnosis from that cluster's *actual* seeded
 * evidence (occurrences, failure rate, affected tests, browsers) and the canned SCM
 * history, then streams believable "thinking" tokens before returning a structured
 * result. Suggested-fix patches are validated for real against the seeded source
 * files, so the "verified patch" badge means the same thing it does in production.
 *
 * Diagnoses are persisted to the in-browser DB so they survive reloads; a
 * force-refresh snapshots the previous result into the version history first.
