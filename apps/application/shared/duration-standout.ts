 * at least `STANDOUT_MIN_MS` and either takes at least `STANDOUT_SHARE` of the
 * test or is much slower than its usual time (`isMuchSlower`), so a test of
 * quick steps colors none of them, and a request that held the test up is the
 * row the eye lands on.
 *
 * The module also holds the one "much slower" rule (`isMuchSlower`: twice as
 * long and at least 1 s longer) and the key a step is matched on from one
 * execution to another (`stepMatchKey`): the Attempts tab reads both when it
 * compares a failing attempt's steps to the passing one's, and the usual
 * durations (`buildUsualDurations`) read the same key over the test's last
