/**
 * Lock-aware, duration-balanced sharding of a resolved test list.
 *
 * Playwright serializes lock holders inside one `npx playwright test` process
 * only: two `--shard` runs are separate processes with no shared held-lock set,
 * so a lock declared on tests split across shards can be held on both at once.
 * Keeping every test that shares a lock in the same shard restores that
 * guarantee. Tests are first grouped by lock (transitively — a lock shared
 * between two tests binds them, and a test carrying two locks binds their
 * groups), then each group is placed whole with longest-processing-time
 * balancing: the heaviest group goes to the lightest shard. A group heavier than
 * a shard's fair share still lands on one shard; balance is best effort, the
 * lock guarantee is not.
