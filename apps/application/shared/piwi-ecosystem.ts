/**
 * What Piwi is made of, the decisions a setup involves, and where feedback goes.

 * The registry behind the MCP `describe_piwi` tool and the "The pieces" and
 * "Choosing a setup" sections of the generated All features page
 * (`apps/docs/reference/features.md`, built by
 * `apps/docs/scripts/generate-features.mjs`), so the tool never says anything
 * the docs site does not. Kept short on purpose: each entry names a page that
 * holds the detail.
 *
 * Dependency-free like the feature catalog, so the docs generator imports it
