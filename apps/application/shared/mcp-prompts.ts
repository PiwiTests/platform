/**
 * Catalog of MCP **prompts** this server exposes — the slash-command-style
 * entries an MCP client offers the user (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, …).
 *
 * Only the catalog (name, description, arguments) lives here, shared so the
 * server route and the in-app MCP setup page can render the same list — the
 * same split `mcp-tools.ts` uses for tools. The message text is built
 * server-side in `server/utils/mcp/prompts.ts`, where it can be filled in with
 * this dashboard's real URL, whether authentication is required, and the
 * projects that already exist.
 *
 * Every workflow skill `piwi skills add` installs is also a prompt, named after
 * the skill: its text is the `SKILL.md` bundled into this build, so a client
 * that cannot read skill files gets the same workflow in the version of the
 * server it talks to. A description here is the skill's own (a unit test
 * compares them).
