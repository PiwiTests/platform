/**
 * Selection health & drift analytics — read-only aggregates that answer the two

 * silently drifted from what it last ran, and which tests does no selection
 * cover ("unselected", the gap nobody can see today).
 *
 * Drift is measured against the stamp `piwi run` writes onto a run: the most
 * recent run stamped with a selection recorded the hash and count its definition
 * resolved to then; re-resolving now and comparing surfaces a silent shrink or
 * widening. Coverage counts only stored selections — the built-ins
 * (`quarantine-free` especially) trivially cover the suite and would drown the
 * signal.
