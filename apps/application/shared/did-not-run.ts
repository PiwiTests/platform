/**
 * Why a test did not run, as the one sentence its execution page leads with in
 * the Most likely row: the test that blocked it in its group, or where the run
 * stopped, from the reason the reporter recorded. A blocker is a part that links
 * to its execution. The note says where the fact comes from (Playwright reports
 * a run cutoff) or what a failed `beforeAll` does to its group.
 *
 * Pure: the handler passes the blocking execution and the run's failed count it
 * already loads, so the server, the demo and the MCP tools say the same.
