/**
 * Turn a failure into a copy-paste way to reproduce it locally, and a ready-made
 * `git bisect` that finds the commit that broke it.
 *
 * Two pure generators, no I/O: the server gathers the run's commit, Playwright
 * version, browser and the last-green commit and hands them here, so the same
 * recipe renders on the cluster page, the execution page, the Markdown export
 * and the `get_fix_plan` MCP tool without any of them re-deriving it.
 *
 * Every command is cross-platform. git, npm and npx behave the same on every
 * OS, so the bash and PowerShell forms of a step are usually identical; the
 * pair is always returned so a caller can offer both without special-casing.
 * Each part degrades on its own: no commit skips the checkout and says so, an
 * unknown Playwright version drops the pin, and a missing bisect window returns
 * a plain reason instead of a script.
