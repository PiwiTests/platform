/**
 * Which runs may feed which analysis: the one eligibility rule.
 *
 * A run's origin says what launched it (`metadata.piwiOrigin`, stamped by the
 * reporter from `PIWI_ORIGIN`, or by the server for imports and CI re-runs). A
 * run replaying a test under injected conditions (Flake Lab, a probe), a bisect
 * step or a reproduction at an older commit says nothing about how the suite
 * behaves today, so each use below names the origins it leaves out, whether it
 * reads complete runs only, and whether an environment incident counts.
 * `isEligibleRun` decides for a run in hand, `eligibleRunSql` and
 * `eligibleExecutionSql` decide the same in a query, from the origin stored in
 * `test_runs.origin`: every write of a run's metadata also writes `runOrigin`
 * of that metadata to the column.
 *
 * Runs stored before the origin existed read as `probe` or `flake-lab` from
 * their lab stamp, `import` from their import record, `ci` when the reporter
 * recorded a CI provider, and `local` otherwise.
 *
 * Local runs (a developer's machine, the desktop app, an editor) count like CI
 * runs, except as the editor's CI failures while a CI run exists on the branch,
 * and for a finished run's outbound effects (its notifications, pull-request
 * comment and commit status, AI diagnosis and auto-heal): a run from an editor
 * never sends them, and a run from a developer's machine or the desktop app
 * sends them only when it ran the whole suite. A finished run's analysis (fix
 * verification, change coverage, the hand-back outcomes) does not follow that
 * rule: each step reads the run under its own use.
