/**
 * The product feature catalog — one entry per user-facing feature, grouped by
 * the four jobs Piwi serves (keep the history, explain the failures, hand back
 * a fix, find what the tests miss), then the routes that carry them to people
 * (trends and reports, other tools) and the operator surface.
 *
 * It is the one grouping of the product. The docs render three things from it:
 * the All features page (`apps/docs/reference/features.md`, built at
 * `docs:gen`), the Features sidebar (`apps/docs/.vitepress/navigation.ts`) and the
 * landing page's cards. An entry's `title` is also its page's H1 and sidebar
 * label, so a feature has one name everywhere.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free in `shared/` so the docs generator can import it with no
 * app/runtime deps, exactly like `piwi-env-vars.ts`. `docs-drift.test.ts`
 * resolves every `doc` target here against a real page + heading, so a renamed
 * page or moved anchor fails the test.
