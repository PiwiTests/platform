# Scenario gaps & the Test Map

<Needs reporter fixtures />

The test catalog lists the tests you have. **Scenario gaps** describe the ones you don't: the route no test requests,
the page nothing visits, the test that is the only thing standing between a page and no test at all. Each gap is a
suggestion with its evidence and a next step, never a verdict.

Gaps come from the **[Test Map](/guide/concepts#test-map)**: one graph per project of what the application exposes
(routes, pages, controls, links, and the handlers and dependencies behind them) and which tests
[reach](/guide/concepts#reach) each of them. It is built from what the reporter and the [capture fixtures](/guide/capture-fixtures) already record: the requests
and page visits of every run.

> **Observed reach, not coverage.** A gap says a test *observably reached* something, or that nothing did, measured
> from real runs, never from instrumented code coverage. "No edge" means "no evidence", not "proof of absence".

## What a gap is

A **[detector](/guide/concepts#detector)** reads the Test Map and the last 30 runs and reports one kind of gap: a
route observed only with success statuses, a node exactly one test reaches, a page that appeared in the latest run, a
declared route nothing requests. [Gap detectors & exposure](/reference/gap-detectors) lists every detector with its
evidence. Each gap names its detector and its **[class](/guide/concepts#gap-class)**:

| Class | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **blind-spot** | nothing reaches it | `Observed 412 times over the last 30 runs, always 200` |
| **false-comfort** | a [probe](/features/probes) broke it and every test still passed | `Tests pass when POST /api/orders breaks` |
| **fragile** | what reaches it could stop at any time | `Only checkout › coupon reaches this` |

[Server probes](/features/probes#server-probes) add **findings** in two more classes, **unhandled** and **degraded**:
the application itself did not cope with the fault, whatever the tests saw.

Gaps are ranked by **[exposure](/guide/concepts#exposure)**, a score from how often the code around a node changes,
how old it is, whether it was part of an earlier escaped failure, and the priority of the tests near it. The score
and its factors show on every gap. Counts are per class, never a coverage percentage: a percentage over an observed
surface looks complete exactly when that surface is sparse.

A changed file no test reaches is a gap too, raised at pull-request time: see
[Uncovered changes in pull requests](/features/uncovered-changes). So is a page with open
[bug reports](/features/bug-reports): a defect that escaped the suite there.

## The Gaps tab

The project page has a **Gaps** tab: gaps and findings grouped by feature and ranked, each with its class, its score
factors and its evidence lines.

The tab opens on the **feature map**: one circle per feature (from the
[`piwi:feature` tag](/reference/test-metadata)), sized by the routes, pages and controls it groups, colored by its
worst open gap, and linked to the features it shares nodes with. The ranked list beside it carries every feature,
however many.

  <img src="/screenshots/scenario-gaps-feature-map.png" alt="Feature map: four feature circles colored by worst gap, beside their counts">
  <figcaption>Four features of an admin console, linked through the routes they share.</figcaption>
</figure>

A feature, or a gap's node, opens in the **feature graph**: the node in the middle, what leads into it on the left,
what it leads to on the right, nodes colored by class and edges by kind. The picture shows the most severe few of each
kind; the **neighbors** list under it has every neighbor, with its relation, worst gap and reaching tests. Click a
node to recenter on it. Agents walk the same graph with the
[`get_feature_graph`](/reference/mcp-tools#get_feature_graph) MCP tool.

</figure>

## Triage

Every gap takes the same four verbs as an inbox item:

<figure>

  <figcaption>Gaps of one feature, ranked, each with its evidence and the inbox verbs.</figcaption>
</figure>

- **Accept** copies a draft test skeleton to your clipboard: a title from the gap, the `piwi:` annotations of the
  nearest test, the path from a reached page to the gap as steps, and a TODO where the assertion goes.
- **Snooze** for a day, a week, or until the node changes.
- **Dismiss** with a reason: *not worth testing*, *covered elsewhere* (which records the covering test as reaching the
  node), or *wrong*.
- **Covered by** names the test that covers it and closes the gap. A gap closed this way stays closed when its
  detector raises it again. The covering test is recorded as reaching the node, but a test recorded by hand does not
  count as observed reach of a control, so it never switches on *control nobody exercises* for the project.

Gaps persist, so triage survives recomputation: a dismissed gap keeps its verdict, and a gap **closes itself** when
the detector no longer finds it, for example once its node gains a trusted test, so "closed this month" is real. A
closed gap that comes back reopens, unless it was closed with **Covered by**. Home lists the gaps accepted more than a week ago whose test was never written.
The map is recomputed after every run and nightly.

</figure>

Every verdict is also a labeled example: accepted and covered-by count *for* a detector, dismissed as *wrong* counts
*against* it. A detector below 60% precision on a project with twenty or more verdicts **mutes itself** there: its
rows leave the pull-request comment and the Gaps digest, its gaps sort last in the Gaps tab, and the Gaps tab and
**Settings → About** say so.

The top new gaps of each project are the **Gaps digest**
[quality report](/features/quality-reports#what-a-report-contains); [schedule it](/features/quality-reports#report-schedules)
to your channels. Agents list and draft gaps with
[`list_scenario_gaps`](/reference/mcp-tools#list_scenario_gaps) and
[`draft_scenario`](/reference/mcp-tools#draft_scenario), give a verdict with
[`triage_gap`](/reference/mcp-tools#triage_gap), and the
[write-the-missing-test](/features/agent-skills) skill drives the loop.

## What feeds the map

Every run adds the routes its tests requested on the application's own origin and the pages they ran locator calls
on or ended on. Three optional sources add the rest:

- **The page inventory.** With `capturePageInventory` on (off by default), the reporter records the controls (role
  and accessible name) and links of each page a passing run visits, at most 200 of each per page, never a field
  value. Control and link nodes, and the detectors that read them, appear only then. See
  [Page inventory](/guide/concepts#page-inventory).
- **Server spans.** With the [backend instrumentation](/guide/backend-logs#server-spans) for Nitro, each route gains
  the handler that served it and the dependencies that handler called.
- **The declared surface**, below.

### Declared surface

Beyond what tests observe, the map can hold what the application *declares* it exposes, so a route or page nothing
reaches is named a **declared, never hit** blind spot instead of staying invisible. Three sources feed it:

- **The instrumentation's route manifest.** The [Nitro plugin](/guide/backend-logs#route-manifest) serves the routes
  it has matched at `/__piwi/manifest` outside production, and the reporter uploads it with the run. The ASP.NET Core
  package serves no manifest.
- **A committed manifest.** A `piwi.manifest.json` next to your Playwright config (`{ "routes": [...], "pages": [...] }`)
  is uploaded whenever present, whatever the backend.
- **An OpenAPI URL**, set per project under Project → Settings → Capabilities → Scenario gaps. Piwi fetches the document
  on a recompute and records each route's documented response codes, so a *success only* gap can name the error codes a
  route documents but never returned under test.

## What this is not

- **Not coverage.** Every surface says *observed reach*.
- **Not a test generator.** A gap proposes a scenario; the assertion is yours.
- **Not a gate.** Uncovered changes can only warn; see [the gate flag](/features/uncovered-changes#the-gate-flag).
- **Not a percentage.** Counts per class, ranked by exposure.

The Test Map and its server probes are optional: [decline](/operate/capabilities#declining-a-capability) either per
project or for the instance, and these surfaces disappear.
