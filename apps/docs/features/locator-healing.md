# Locator healing

<Needs reporter fixtures />

When a locator stops matching (a button was renamed, an element moved, a hashed class changed), Piwi suggests
concrete, ranked replacements, captured from the last run where the test passed, instead of leaving you to guess.
Healing is read-only: it never rewrites your test. [Auto-heal PRs](./auto-heal) is the separate, opt-in feature that
opens the fix as a pull request.

## What it does

While tests run, the [capture fixtures](/guide/capture-fixtures) record a [locator snapshot](/guide/concepts#locator-snapshot)
after each successful action **or passing web-first assertion** (a passing `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` proves the
element resolved just as a click does): the target element's attributes, plus alternative locators ranked by a
stability score (`data-testid` = 100, role + accessible name ≈ 90, semantic CSS ≈ 35–40, hash-suffixed ≈ 10). Capture
also generates **rename-proof** alternatives: locators scoped to a stable ancestor
(`getByTestId('signup-form').getByRole('textbox')` ≈ 72, a unique landmark ≈ 55) and a name-free `getByRole` when the
element is the only one of its role. Each candidate is checked against the live page, and one that would match several
elements is dropped. Input values are never captured.

</figure>

When a locator later fails, the server looks for replacements, most trustworthy first:

1. **Diff rename**: the run's own diff renamed the string the locator finds its element by, at this call site, as
   [Locator preflight](./preflight) predicts it with a _likely_ break. The replacement is the same locator with the new string, and the
   panel says where: "“Pay now” became “Pay” in CheckoutButton.vue:14". It needs a run with a diff (a pull request,
   or a commit after a passing run) and a source-control token. Its edit replaces the string inside your quotes, and
   an [auto-heal PR](./auto-heal) can use it.
2. **Prior run**: the same call site (`file:line:col`) had a passing snapshot.
3. **Element match**: the element is gone from the failing page's ARIA snapshot under its old name, so fresh locators
   are generated for the element it most likely became, matched by role, heading level and, on a total rename, its
   position among elements of the same role.
4. **Fingerprint**: the call site moved lines, but the locator matches a prior snapshot.
5. **Cross-test**: another test in the project captured the same locator.
6. **ARIA fallback**: no snapshot exists, so limited suggestions come from the failure-time ARIA snapshot.

<figure>
  <img src="/diagrams/locator-healing-resolution.svg" alt="Diagram of the healing resolution flow: the failing error is parsed into a locator signature and call site, matched through the stored history, checked against the failing page's ARIA snapshot, and shown in the Locator fix panel">
  <figcaption>Every stored match is checked against the failing page before anything is recommended.</figcaption>
</figure>

A single **recommended fix** is highlighted. It keeps your locator *style* where that style is stable enough, and only
otherwise escalates to the sturdiest alternative or advises adding a `data-testid`. When the stored accessible name is
provably gone from the failing page, name-based alternatives, the failing locator included, stay listed but are never
recommended.

When a strict-mode violation matched several elements and only **one is visible**, the panel also suggests adding
Playwright's `.visible()` (1.63 and later), the right fix when the duplicates are hidden copies rather than a naming
problem.

## Where it is

The **Locator fix** section of **More ways to fix**, on the [execution](./evidence#one-execution-diagnosis-first) and
failure cluster pages. The same result goes into the [AI diagnosis](./ai-diagnosis#locator-healing) context and the
[fix plan](./fix-plans), and reaches agents through the `get_locator_healing` [MCP tool](/features/mcp).

</figure>

## Use it

Copy the recommended fix, or another alternative, and change the line the panel names. With an uploaded trace,
**Pick from trace** opens the failure in the dashboard's [trace viewer](./evidence#trace-viewer), whose *Pick locator*
tool works on the recorded page snapshots, so a CI failure nobody watched can still be picked visually. A replacement
you confirmed with a picker shows a **Your pick** badge and becomes the recommended fix.

## Inspect the failing page live (local runs)

With `inspectOnFailure: true` (or `PIWI_INSPECT_ON_FAIL=true`), a failing test opens **Piwi's own inspector overlay**
on its still-open page right before the browser closes. Click any element to get ranked, uniqueness-checked locators
for it; one you confirm is recorded like a pick. It is not Playwright's inspector, so what you confirm flows back into
the healing data.

```bash
# Linux / macOS
PIWI_INSPECT_ON_FAIL=true npx playwright test --headed

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:PIWI_INSPECT_ON_FAIL='true'; npx playwright test --headed
```

Both local options need a **headed** browser (`--headed` or `headless: false`), never activate under CI (any `CI`
variable), skip expected failures (`test.fail()`), and with retries configured open only on the final attempt. The run
waits while the overlay is open (the test timeout is lifted), so prefer `--workers=1`.

## Pick a replacement locator on the failing page (local runs)

With `pickLocatorOnFailure: true` (or `PIWI_PICK_LOCATOR_ON_FAIL=true`), a test that failed on a locator, in an action
(`.click()`, `.fill()`) or an assertion (`expect(locator).toBeVisible()`), gets the same overlay aimed at the locator
that broke:

1. **Pick the element.** The pick snaps to the nearest actionable ancestor, and <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd> walk the DOM
   tree before you click, showing the locator each step would produce.
2. **Choose stable parents (optional).** The element's ancestors are listed with their strongest hook (`data-testid`,
   `#id`, labeled landmark, role); selecting one scopes the locator to it, with a live **"matches N"** count.
3. **Confirm** one of the ranked candidates.

```bash
# Linux / macOS
PIWI_PICK_LOCATOR_ON_FAIL=true npx playwright test --headed

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:PIWI_PICK_LOCATOR_ON_FAIL='true'; npx playwright test --headed
```

The pick is recorded in the run's locator snapshots, so the **Locator fix** panel shows it first once the run uploads,
as a `piwi-user-pick` attachment and annotation in the Playwright report, and in the terminal with the call site and
the replacement. The picker blocks the page's own click handlers while active, so picking can't navigate away. The
same picker ships as the [Piwi Picker browser extension](/features/extension), for any live page with no test run.

## Limits

- Healing runs only when the locator **never resolved**, matched nothing, or matched several elements. When it resolved
  and the step failed afterwards (`element is not enabled`, a wrong count, a hidden element) or the page failed to
  load, the panel says *The locator resolved; this is not a locator problem*, because rewriting a locator that found
  its element would be a harmful edit.
- Suggestions need a passing run captured with the fixtures in place; until then only the ARIA fallback applies.
- Capture costs one DOM read per call site, at most once per call site per test. Negated assertions, absence checks
  (`toBeHidden`, `toBeDetached`) and multi-element checks (`toHaveCount`) are never probed. Turn it off with
  `captureLocators: false` or `PIWI_CAPTURE_LOCATORS=false`; it is also off whenever `collectPerformanceMetrics` is
  `false`.
