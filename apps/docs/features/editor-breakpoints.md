# Breakpoints in the browser

<Needs reporter fixtures />

A breakpoint you set with the editor's own gutter click pauses the next test run the [editor extensions](./editors)
start, in the browser, right before the locator action or assertion on its line. Piwi's bar at the top of the page lets
you look at the page, step through the actions, or pick a better locator, which lands back on that line in the editor.
It is not Playwright's inspector, and no debugger attaches: the test waits in the browser.

## Pause a run

1. Set a line breakpoint on a line that calls a locator, in a spec or a page object:
   `await page.getByText('Pay now').click();`.
2. Run the test from Piwi: **Run this test**, the lines above a locator, **Piwi: Run the tests that reach this file**,
   **Piwi: Run selection…** or **Re-run the failing tests** ([Runs from the editor](./editor-runs#run-tests)).
3. The run opens a headed browser. Before the action on your line runs, its element is highlighted and the pause bar
   appears: `Paused at login.spec.ts:42 · click · getByText('Pay now')`.

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Resume** (<kbd>Esc</kbd>) | Runs on to the next breakpoint |
| **Step** | Pauses again before the next locator action or assertion, breakpoint or not |
| **Pick a locator** | Opens Piwi's [element picker](/features/locator-healing#pick-a-replacement-locator-on-the-failing-page-local-runs): pick the element, choose stable parents, confirm a ranked locator; the bar comes back after |
| **Finish** | Runs on without pausing again in this test |

The page under the bar stays live: scroll it, open the browser's developer tools, or click through it before you
resume. The test timeout stops while the test is paused, and the test has the time it had left once it resumes.

## Where the pick lands

A locator you confirm replaces the locator chain on the breakpoint's line, in the file as it stands, saved or not:
`page.getByText('Pay now').click()` becomes `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Pay now' }).click()`, and a
notification says so. When the line holds no locator, because you edited it during the pause or it takes its locator
from a page object (`checkout.payButton().click()`), the locator is inserted at the cursor instead, and the
notification says why.

The pick is also printed in the run's terminal (`[piwi] Locator picked at tests/login.spec.ts:42: getByRole(…)`) and
recorded in the run's locator snapshots, so the [Locator fix](/features/locator-healing) panel shows it as **Your
pick** once the run uploads.

The run reaches the editor through the address [Piwi Picker sends to](./editor-recording#send-from-piwi-picker): VS
Code starts its listener when a run with breakpoints starts, and the JetBrains plugin answers on the IDE's built-in
server. Nothing is copied to the clipboard.

## The setting

Breakpoints are on by default. Turn them off with the `piwi.breakpoints` setting in VS Code, or **Pause the runs Piwi
starts at the editor's breakpoints** under **Settings → Tools → Piwi** in a JetBrains IDE, kept on your machine only.
With the setting off, a run started from Piwi ignores the editor's breakpoints.

## What it needs

- **`@piwitests/reporter` 0.48.0 or later**, with the [capture fixtures](/guide/capture-fixtures) in your tests: the
  pause runs in them. The status bar's tooltip names the reporter version the project installs. With an older one,
  the run starts anyway and the editor warns once: `Breakpoints need @piwitests/reporter 0.48.0 or later; this project
  has 0.46.0.`
- **A run started from Piwi.** The editor passes the breakpoints under the Playwright config's folder to the run as
  `PIWI_PAUSE_AT` (`tests/login.spec.ts:42`, relative to that folder), with its pairing address as
  `PIWI_EDITOR_SEND`, and adds `--headed` to the command unless it already has `--headed`, `--ui` or `--debug`. Set
  `PIWI_PAUSE_AT` yourself to [pause a run you start](/features/locator-healing#pause-at-a-breakpoint-local-runs).

## Limits

- **Headed and local only.** Under CI (`CI` set to anything but empty or `false`) or in a headless browser, the run
  ignores the breakpoints and says why once in its output.
- **Only locator actions and assertions pause**: `click()`, `fill()`, `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` and the like. A
  breakpoint on `page.goto`, on a helper call or on a line with no locator call does nothing. A breakpoint on the line
  of a page object method that runs an action pauses every test that calls the method.
- **Every attempt pauses.** With retries, a test pauses again on its retry, and the bar says `attempt 2`.
- **Each worker pauses its own browser.** When several tests reach a breakpoint, run them with `--workers=1` to pause
  one at a time.
- Stepping through the test's JavaScript stays with the editor's own debugger and Playwright's.
