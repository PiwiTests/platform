# MCP server

<Needs reporter />

The dashboard serves a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** at `/mcp` from its own process, with nothing to
install. Any MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI) can query your test
results, failure clusters and AI diagnoses, and triage them. The **MCP server** page in the dashboard has a live setup
guide for this instance.

## What it provides

The server exposes tools, mostly read-only, from listing projects to one failure's full evidence and a cluster's
fix plan; [MCP tools](/reference/mcp-tools) lists every one. Two answer questions about Piwi itself:
`describe_piwi` reads the documentation bundled with the server, and `get_release_notes` the changelog up to the
running version. They return compact JSON, list tools page with `{ items, nextCursor }` (`get_project_test_catalog`
with `offset`/`nextOffset`), and a tool that fails returns a normal result with `isError: true` and a readable
message (one whose SCM or AI provider is not configured returns `{ error }`).

**Modules.** Every tool belongs to one module, `core`, `workflow`, `healing` or `agents`, the groups the Setup page
asks about. Declining a capability drops the tools that depend on it. Append `?modules=core` (comma-separated) to the
MCP URL to narrow the list further; narrowing never re-enables a declined tool.

**Access.** The server follows the REST API's project assignments: with authentication on, a non-admin key reads only
its projects, and cross-project tools (`list_recent_activity`, `list_open_clusters`, `search`) are filtered to them.
The write tools (triaging clusters and gaps, deciding a merge suggestion, setting a bug report's status or a run's
incident flag, re-running a cluster in CI, linking or filing an issue, setting a cluster's baseline commit, running,
recording or rating a diagnosis, reporting a fix attempt, registering a test function) need the **reporter** or
**administrator** role, as the same actions do in the dashboard and the REST API, and `get_instance_stats` the
administrator role.

**The write log.** Every call of a write tool is logged with the API key that made it, the tool, what it acted on and
the result; read tools never are. A cluster's **Activity** section shows the calls on it, the log is pruned after
`PIWI_RETENTION_NOTIFICATION_DAYS`, and declining the **Agent write log** capability on the Setup page keeps none.

**Transport.** Streamable HTTP: JSON-RPC 2.0 over `POST /mcp`, with no SSE or WebSocket. Protocol versions
`2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26` and `2024-11-05` are supported.

## Authentication

The MCP server takes the same API keys as the REST API: `pd_` keys, created in **Settings → Account → API keys**
(administrators manage anyone's keys from **Settings → Users**). Pass the key as a Bearer token on every request:

```
Authorization: Bearer pd_YOUR_API_KEY
```

When `PIWI_AUTH_ENABLED` is not set, every request is accepted without a key, except in the desktop app, which
requires its local access token as the Bearer value.

## Client setup

Replace `<your-piwi-url>` with your dashboard base URL (for example `http://localhost:3000`) and `pd_YOUR_API_KEY`
with a real API key. In the [desktop app](/features/desktop#connecting-ai-assistants), the MCP server page detects
the installed clients and writes their entry in one click instead.

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http piwi <your-piwi-url>/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer pd_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Restart Claude Code, then check with `/mcp` that **piwi** is listed.

### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "piwi": {
      "url": "<your-piwi-url>/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer pd_YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code (GitHub Copilot, agent mode)

With the [Piwi extension](/features/editors) installed and connected, VS Code 1.101 and later list Piwi's server
without any configuration. Otherwise:

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace (VS Code 1.99+):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "piwi": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "<your-piwi-url>/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer pd_YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Claude\` on
Windows), then restart Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "piwi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "<your-piwi-url>/mcp",
        "--transport",
        "http-only",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer pd_YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude Desktop only starts local commands from this file and ignores an entry with a `url`, so
[`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote), a small Node bridge, carries the HTTP connection; `npx`
needs Node on your PATH. The header goes through `env` because Claude Desktop mishandles arguments with spaces. Plans
that offer **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** take the `/mcp` URL directly.

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini mcp add --transport http piwi <your-piwi-url>/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer pd_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Windsurf / Continue

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "piwi": {
      "serverUrl": "<your-piwi-url>/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer pd_YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Windsurf reads `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`; Continue reads `~/.continue/config.json`, under `mcpServers`.

## Prompts

The server also exposes MCP **prompts**, which a client offers as slash commands. `setup_piwi` generates the setup
for a Playwright project that does not report here yet. It fills in this instance's URL, whether it requires a key
and its existing projects, then walks the agent through `npx @piwitests/reporter init`, the API key and a first run.
The six workflow [agent skills](/features/agent-skills) are prompts too (`investigate_failure`,
`apply_locator_healing`, `stabilize_flaky_tests`, `run_the_right_tests`, `write_the_missing_test`,
`fix_a_reported_bug`), each with an optional `focus` argument, in the version this server ships.
