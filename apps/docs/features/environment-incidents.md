# Environment incidents

<Needs reporter />

When the environment under test is down, every test fails at once: staging refuses connections, a DNS name stops
resolving, the browser crashes on a starved runner. None of those failures says anything about the tests or the code.
Piwi recognizes such a run as an **environment incident**, says so on the run page, and keeps it out of every verdict
that compares runs.

## How a run is recognized

When a run finishes, Piwi reads what it already stored: how many tests failed, what each failure was doing, and the
host of the run's Playwright `baseURL`. A run is flagged by one of three rules:

| Rule | Flags the run when |
|---|---|
| `host-unreachable` | At least 80% of the executed tests failed, and at least 70% of the failures were navigating or connecting to the app's host |
| `browser-crash` | At least 80% of the executed tests failed, and at least 70% of the failures were the browser crashing or closing |
| `cross-project` | At least 50% of the executed tests failed, most failures reached the app's host or share one error, and the same host or error failed in another project's run that started within 30 minutes |

A failure counts as reaching the host when it is a network error (`net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, a name that does not
resolve, a reset connection, `ECONNREFUSED` from a request fixture) or a `page.goto` that timed out, and the address
it names is the host of the run's `baseURL`. With no `baseURL` recorded, the host most failures reached stands in for
it.

A failure whose error names no such address also counts when the network capture of its execution (recorded by the
[capture fixtures](/guide/capture-fixtures)) holds a request to the `baseURL` host that got no answer: a network error
such as a refused connection, or a `502`, `503` or `504` from a gateway in front of the app. That catches an API that
is down behind a page that still loads, where the tests fail on assertions. A `500` is the app answering, and an
aborted route (`net::ERR_FAILED`) is the test's own doing, so neither counts. Piwi reads the capture of at most 500
failing executions per run, and a failure whose capture it did not read counts as not reaching the host.

A third-party host going down (a CDN, an analytics script) does not count, and neither does a failing assertion whose
requests were answered, however many tests it breaks: a login page broken by a commit is a regression, not an
incident. A run with fewer than three failing tests is never flagged.

A [probe](./probes) or [Flake Lab](./flake-lab) run is never judged: it injects its failures on purpose.

## What a flagged run changes

- **The run page** says *Environment incident · not counted*, the reason (*41 of 44 tests failed, 39 of them
  navigating or connecting to staging.example.test (connection refused)*), and which rule decided.
- **Flaky scores, baselines, fix verification, the selection catalog, the editor's CI failures and auto-heal** leave
  the run out. A test that failed only in the incident does not become flaky, does not lose its last green run, and
  does not count as a regression. The run gets no regression signals.
- **One timeline marker** in the `incident` category, labeled *Environment incident: staging.example.test* and linked
  to the run, so the gap on the trend charts has a visible cause (unless `PIWI_AUTO_MARKERS=false`). See
  [Timeline markers](./timeline-markers).
- **One notification**, [`environment.incident`](/reference/notification-events), in place of the run's failure,
  flakiness, performance and new-cluster events. It goes to the project's subscribers, not to a subscription scoped to
  test owners. `run.finished` still fires. When one outage flags runs in several projects, a channel that hears from
  all of them receives one message.
- **The failure inbox** on Home shows one row for the run instead of one row per new cluster it opened. Clusters that
  were already open before the incident keep their rows.
- **No AI diagnosis and no pull-request comment** are produced for the run.

The run's history stays: its executions, evidence and clusters are kept like any other run's, and analytics still
count it as a failed run.

## The CI gate

[`piwi gate`](/reference/cli#gate) gives a flagged run the verdict **inconclusive**, distinct from a pass and a fail,
whatever the policy says. It exits with code `3`, so a pipeline can tell "the environment was down, re-run" from "the
change broke something" (`1`):

```text
? Piwi gate inconclusive — checkout run #930
  41 tests, 41 failed, 0 new, 0 newly flaky, 0 flaky
  ? The run is an environment incident: 41 of 44 tests failed, 39 of them navigating or connecting to staging.example.test (connection refused).
  Re-run once the environment is back, or clear the flag on the run page if it is wrong.
```

The gate's JSON result carries `verdict: "inconclusive"`, `passed: false` and the incident under `facts.incident`, so
a client that reads only `passed` still blocks the merge.

## Marking and clearing by hand

The rules can miss an outage or flag a real regression. Anyone who can edit the run can decide instead:

- **Mark as an environment incident**, in the run header's **Details**, for a run the rules did not flag (the payment
  sandbox was down, a shared account was locked). The run is left out of the same verdicts and gets its marker.
- **Clear the flag**, on a flagged run, when its failures are real. The incident marker is removed and the run counts
  again: its regression signals are computed, and it feeds flaky scores and baselines from then on.

Either decision is kept on the run, and finalizing the run again (a late shard, a report upload) never overrides it.
The run page says who decided. The same action is in the [API reference](https://piwitests.dev/demo/docs), and an
agent makes it with the MCP tool [`set_run_incident`](/reference/mcp-tools#set_run_incident), which needs a reporter
or administrator key and is kept in the [write log](./mcp).

## Limits

- The check runs once, when the run finishes. A run in another project that finishes later is compared with this one
  and names it, but this run's flag is not revisited.
- An incident that hits only part of the suite (one service down, 30% of the tests failing) stays below the
  thresholds: mark it by hand.
- Clearing or marking a run after it finished does not send the notifications it skipped, or withdraw the ones it
  sent.
