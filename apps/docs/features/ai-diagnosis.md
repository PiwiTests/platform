# AI diagnosis

When a run finishes, Piwi groups related failures into [failure clusters](./failure-clusters) and, optionally, asks an
LLM to explain them. Clustering decides *what* to diagnose; AI diagnosis explains *why* it broke, against the code that
changed.

## Semantic merging (optional)

If an **embedding** model role is configured (Settings → AI), Piwi adds a semantic layer on top of the deterministic
fingerprint. After a run, the clusters first seen in it are embedded and compared (cosine similarity) against the
project's other open clusters; near-duplicates above `PIWI_CLUSTER_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` (default `0.92`) are merged
into the longest-lived cluster, and a fingerprint alias sends future occurrences to the survivor. This catches one root
cause phrased differently enough to dodge the fingerprint. The text is cleaned before embedding (ANSI codes, framework
stack frames and volatile tokens removed), and older clusters without a vector are embedded a few at a time over the
runs that follow.

Pairs in the **ambiguous band**, between `PIWI_CLUSTER_SUGGEST_THRESHOLD` (default `0.80`) and the merge threshold, are
not merged automatically. When AI is configured, a model judges the pair from its error text, locators, most-affected
tests and overlap: it merges on a confident yes, turns a less confident yes into a **merge suggestion** on the
project's Failure clusters tab, for a reporter or admin to approve or dismiss, and leaves a no apart. Without AI, or
past five model calls in a run, the pair becomes a suggestion directly. This runs after every finished run
whenever an embedding role is configured, independently of auto-diagnose.

</figure>

With auto-diagnose on, new clusters also get a short **title** from one cheap batched model call per run. Without one,
a cluster is named from its error kind, locator, route and spec file, such as
`Timeout on getByLabel('Email address') in checkout.spec.ts`.

## Enabling AI diagnosis

AI diagnosis needs an [AI provider](/guide/ai-provider): the providers, model roles, streaming and automatic diagnosis of new clusters are set up there.

## Response language

A diagnosis comes back in the [response language](/guide/ai-provider#response-language) set for the instance or the project.

## What a diagnosis contains

A diagnosis is grounded in your actual run, not a generic "ask AI" button. Each result includes:

- **Category** and **confidence**
- **Root cause**: the most likely explanation
- **Evidence**: the signals the model relied on, each citing a section of the page
- **Suggested fix** and **prevention tips**

## Diagnosing one execution

A cluster page diagnoses every failure that shares a fingerprint. On a single failing
[execution](./evidence#one-execution-diagnosis-first), the **Diagnosis** section of **More ways to fix** shows the
cluster's completed diagnosis with an **Open** link to it; without one, it diagnoses just that execution, with the same
panel and model: handy when a failure has not clustered yet. Execution and cluster
diagnoses are stored separately, and running one never overwrites the other.

A stored diagnosis stays on screen even with no provider configured. With no result and no provider, **Copy prompt**
copies the exact request the model would receive, trimmed to the
[context limits](/guide/ai-provider#context-limits-and-token-cost), so you can paste it into your own AI tool.

## SCM-grounded context

The diagnosis is fed the code that changed. On a cluster page you can:

- **Pin a baseline commit**: the diagnosis includes the diff between that commit and the run.
- **Browse and cherry-pick commits**: add the full diff of specific commits.
- **Preview the exact context** before running it, so nothing leaves your server by surprise.

Without a pinned baseline, the diff starts at the last green run before the cluster first appeared, else at the last
run where this test passed; the context preview names which one it used. With the repository reachable, Piwi also sends the
**full current content** of the most suspect changed files and of the failing test's local imports (page objects,
helpers, fixtures), capped by `PIWI_AI_MAX_SOURCE_FILES` (default 4) and `PIWI_AI_MAX_SOURCE_FILE_CHARS`. The
repository connection is set up on [Source control](/guide/source-control).

### Validated patches

Every suggested patch is checked before it reaches you, by dry-running each hunk against the source files the model
was shown. The patch carries one badge: **Applies cleanly**, **Applies with offset** (`git apply` should still succeed),
**Does not apply** (the file diverged), **Invalid diff**, or **Unverified** (the file was not in the context). The model
is told to return no patch unless it can quote the lines it changes. Applying a patch is always manual: **Copy**,
**Copy `git apply` command** or **Download `.patch`**. Only [auto-heal](./auto-heal) writes to your repository, with
deterministic locator edits rather than model output.

## Locator healing

When the failure is a broken locator, the context includes the ranked replacements and the recommended fix from
[Locator healing](./locator-healing), and the model is told to use that fix rather than invent a locator.

## Fix plans

The diagnosis, its patch, the locator fix and the verify command come together in a fix plan: see
[Fix plans, reproduce & bisect](./fix-plans).

## Diagnosis history

Every re-diagnose keeps the previous result; a nightly sweep keeps the newest 20 per cluster
(`PIWI_RETENTION_DIAGNOSIS_VERSIONS`, `0` keeps all). **History** in the panel header lists them
newest first, with the model, category, confidence and token cost, and shows what changed since each one.

A re-diagnose sends the previous assessment to the model: its category, confidence, summary and root cause, the
cluster's triage note, and, when you rated it unhelpful, your note and an instruction not to repeat it without new
evidence. A rating belongs to the version it rated: the new diagnosis starts unrated, and the history keeps the old
one's thumbs.

A diagnosis is flagged **may be stale** only when the evidence changed since it ran **and** the cluster is still
failing; the banner says whether new occurrences or new evidence caused it.

## Custom instructions

Tailor the analysis to your stack with **global** instructions (Settings → AI) and **per-project** instructions (Project → Settings → AI diagnosis). Use them to describe your architecture, common false positives, or house style for fixes.

## Context limits (and token cost)

Each input sent to the model is capped to keep diagnoses fast and affordable; the caps are set on the [AI provider](/guide/ai-provider#context-limits-and-token-cost) page.

## Privacy

API keys are encrypted at rest with [`PIWI_SECRET_KEY`](/reference/configuration#general). When you run a diagnosis, the bounded context above is sent to your configured provider, so for fully local analysis, use Ollama or another self-hosted OpenAI-compatible model and keep everything on your own infrastructure.

## Try it in the demo

The [live demo](https://piwitests.dev/demo/) needs no AI provider: some clusters carry a completed diagnosis with a validated patch, and the others run a simulated streaming diagnosis.
