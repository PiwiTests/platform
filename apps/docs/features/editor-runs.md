# Runs from the editor

The [editor extensions](./editors) run your tests where you edit them, then show what the run changed: its progress
in the status bar while it executes, and its results over the latest CI run's failures within a second of its end.

## Run tests

- The lines above a locator line, an application file or a page file (CodeLens in VS Code, Code Vision in a JetBrains
  IDE) run the tests they name when clicked.
- **Piwi: Run the tests that reach this file** runs every test that reaches the active file through
  [code reach](/features/code-reach); it is also in the editor's context menu.
- **Piwi: Run selection…** runs one of the project's saved [selections](/features/test-selection).

The command is the one `piwi run` would build, run from the Playwright config's folder: in a terminal in VS Code, in
the Run tool window in a JetBrains IDE, whose **Rerun** starts it again. It sets `PIWI_ORIGIN=editor` and a
`PIWI_ORIGIN_REF` of its own ([run origin](/reference/test-metadata#run-origin)), by which the editor finds its run on
the instance.

## Your local runs

A later finished run on the branch, from the editor, `piwi run`, `npx playwright test` or the desktop app, overlays the
latest CI run per test and Playwright project: a test it fixed leaves the Problems panel, its lens saying *fixed
locally in run #124*; a test failing in it is an error labeled *local run #124*, or *your run #124* when this editor
started it.

## After a run

The editor listens to the instance's event stream: within a second of a run of the project ending, it reads the
branch's latest run and its failures again. While the stream is connected, it also reads them every five minutes, which
catches a run reported to another server of an instance scaled out without sticky sessions; when the stream is
unavailable, such as behind a proxy that buffers it, every minute.

A run started from the editor is its own wherever it runs: the status bar follows it as it runs, and its failures
read *your run #124* once it ends. When the command ends and no run on the instance carries its ref, the editor says
so: `The run ended (exit code 1) but did not reach https://piwi.example.com: is the Piwi reporter in the Playwright
config?` VS Code learns that a command ended through shell integration (VS Code 1.93 and later), and gives each run
a terminal of its own; without it, the runs of a folder share one terminal, the run is still found and followed, and a
run that never arrived goes unmentioned.

## When your run ends

Once a run you started from the editor ends and the editor has read it, a notification (a balloon in a JetBrains IDE)
says what it changed: `Piwi: run #124 · 1 of 3 CI failures fixed, 2 still failing (login.spec.ts › logs in,
checkout.spec.ts › pays)`, then the tests it failed that were not failing before. It offers **Open the failures**,
**Open in dashboard** and, when something fails, **Re-run failing**. The `piwi.runNotifications` setting (**Settings →
Tools → Piwi** in a JetBrains IDE) shows it always, only when something fails, or never.

While the run executes, the gutter follows it: a test shows as running when it begins, then its result as soon as it
ends, until the run is read and the gutter shows the latest results again.

## Failures follow your edits

A run reports the line a test failed at in the files it ran. The editor reads those files as the run saw them and
follows each failing line through your changes, saved or not:

- Add or remove lines above a failing line, and its error moves with it: in the Problems panel, in the lines above the
  test, in the Piwi tool window of a JetBrains IDE.
- Rewrite the failing line, and the error turns into an information marker, *Edited since run #120: …*: the run said
  nothing about the new line. **Run this test** comes first among its quick fixes, and the reason above the line reads
  *✎ edited since run #120*. The test keeps its failing mark until a run says otherwise.
- Delete the test, and its failure leaves the editor.

The next run that covers the test says what is true: a failure there is an error again, at the line it failed at, and
a pass takes the failure away.

For a CI run, the files as the run saw them are those of the run's commit, read with `git show` once per commit and
file. For a run on your machine, which ran your files as saved, a run that recorded no commit, or a commit your clone
does not have, they are the files as saved when the editor first showed the failure.

## The failures view

The latest run's failures as a tree: the **Failures** view of the **Piwi** panel in VS Code, the Piwi tool window in a
JetBrains IDE. Its first node is the run, `Run #120 · CI · feature/x · 3 failing · 1 fixed locally`, with its age, or
the progress of the run you started (`running 4/9`). Under it:

- **Your runs since** lists the runs laid over it, such as `#124 · your run · 2 min ago · 1 passed, 0 failed`; a click
  opens one in the dashboard.
- The failures, grouped by spec (the default), by [failure cluster](/features/failure-clusters), by owner, or flat:
  **Group by…** in the view's title bar, the toggles of the tool window's toolbar. The choice is kept for the
  workspace, and each group counts its failures.
- A failure shows its title, where it failed (`tests/login.spec.ts:42 · chromium · new`), and an icon for failing,
  edited since the run, or fixed locally, with the headline and its run (`your run #124`, `edited since run #120`).

Click a failure (double-click or Enter in a JetBrains IDE) to open its line. **Run this test**, **Open the trace** and
**Open in dashboard** sit on its row in VS Code; the context menu adds **Open the screenshot**, **Copy context for
agent**, and, on a CI failure while the [desktop app](/features/desktop#jobs-from-your-editor) runs, **Reproduce in the
desktop app** and **Find the breaking commit in the desktop app**. **Heal** stays a quick fix on the line.

The title bar, or the toolbar, holds Refresh, **Re-run the failing tests**, **Open the run in the dashboard** and the
grouping. In VS Code, **Follow the active editor** selects the first failure of the file you switch to, and the badge
counts the failing tests, as the tool window's title does. The tree is read again when a run ends or an edit moves a
failure, and keeps what you expanded. The Problems panel keeps its errors.

## Re-run the failing tests

**Piwi: Re-run the failing tests** (**Tools → Piwi → Re-run the Failing Tests**) runs every test still failing, or
edited since its run, in one command; when none fails, it says so. **Run this test** also sits above the reason line of
a failing test, beside **Screenshot** and **Trace**.

## The status bar

The latest complete run on the branch: how many tests passed, failed and were flaky, or what still fails and what your
local runs fixed (`2 failing · 1 fixed locally`). While a run started from this editor, or another run of the branch,
is in progress, the item counts it instead (`4/9 · 1 failing · your run`) and returns to the latest run when it ends.

Click it to read the latest run and its failures again, without the indexes **Piwi: Refresh** fetches; **Piwi:
Refresh the latest run** does the same. The tooltip holds the run's counts, your local runs since, the run in
progress, and when the run was read (`Updated 12 s ago · live` while the event stream is connected, `· read every
minute` without it). In VS Code it ends with **Open run #120**, **Open in dashboard** and **Connect**; in a JetBrains
IDE, **Tools → Piwi → Open the Latest Run in the Dashboard**, also in the Piwi tool window's toolbar, opens the run.
When the extension is not connected, the item says why, and a click runs **Piwi: Connect**.
