# Uncovered changes in pull requests

<Needs reporter scm />

A pull request that changes `server/api/orders/[id].patch.ts` while no test ever requests that route passes CI and
proves nothing about the change. When a run finishes, Piwi joins the files its change touched to the tests that
[observably reach](/guide/concepts#reach) them, and names the changed files nothing reaches. Each one is a
*changed, unreached* [scenario gap](/features/scenario-gaps), with a draft scenario to start from.

## What counts as reached

A changed file counts as reached when a test that ran recently touches it:

- a route or page the file serves, matched by the framework's file naming (`server/api/**`, `server/routes/**`, Nuxt
  `pages/**`), that a test requested or visited;
- a test step whose locator is written in the file (a page object, a helper), or the file is the spec that defines
  the test.
- with [code reach](/features/code-reach) on, a test executed one of the file's functions.

"No test in this run" is always paired with the count from the last 30 runs, so a run narrowed by a
[selection](/features/test-selection) is never mistaken for a gap. A skipped test reaches nothing. A file that no route,
page or test source maps to says so: no evidence either way.

The diff comes from the [source control](/guide/source-control) connection: a pull-request run is compared with its
base branch, any other run with the commit of the last passing run. With no SCM token or no diff, nothing appears.

## On the pull request

With [pull-request feedback](/features/pr-feedback) turned on, the comment gains an **Uncovered changes** section,
grouped by ticket (read from the commit messages and the pull request):

```md
#### 🟣 Uncovered changes · 3 of 7 files · 2 tickets
Observed reach, not instrumented coverage. This run and the last 30 on `main`.

**PROJ-418**
- `server/api/orders/[id].patch.ts` · changed (+41 −3) · 0 tests in 30 runs
  → *a scenario that exercises [id].patch.ts* · draft
```

When commit statuses are on too, a second status joins the run's own: `piwi/tests/change-coverage` with the default
status context, described as *3 of 7 changed files have no observed reach*. It is always **success**, so it informs a
reviewer without blocking the merge. The section and the status are left out while the *changed, unreached*
detector is [muted](/features/scenario-gaps#triage) on the project, or where the Test Map is declined.

## From an agent

The [`get_change_coverage`](/reference/mcp-tools#get_change_coverage) MCP tool returns the same join for a run or for
an explicit base and head commit, grouped by ticket, without recording anything. The
[write-the-missing-test](/features/agent-skills) skill takes it from there. The REST endpoint is in the
[API docs](https://piwitests.dev/demo/docs).

## The gate flag

`piwi gate --max-uncovered-changes <n>` adds a warning to the [gate](/guide/ci#blocking-a-merge) result when more
than `n` changed files have no observed reach. It is **warn-only**: it never changes the verdict or the exit code,
because observed reach is evidence, not proof. Without the flag, the gate ignores uncovered changes.

## Limits

- **Observed reach, not coverage.** A reached file may still hide an untested branch; an unreached one may be dead
  code.
- **Naming conventions.** Files map to routes and pages through Nitro and Nuxt file naming; other frameworks rely on
  locators and spec files, so more of their files show as *no evidence*.
- **Ten files listed.** The comment names at most ten uncovered files and counts the rest.
