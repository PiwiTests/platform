# Why Piwi?

Piwi Dashboard gives your Playwright results a permanent, self-hosted home — with live streaming, failure clustering, flaky-test analytics, and optional AI diagnosis on top. This page explains how it relates to tools you may already use, and answers the questions we hear most.

## The landscape

Every tool below is good at what it targets. The honest differences:

- **Playwright HTML report** — excellent for debugging a single run locally. But it's per-run and ephemeral: once the next CI build uploads its artifact, yesterday's context is gone, and there's no cross-run view (trends, flakiness, clustering) at all. Piwi doesn't replace it for local work — it replaces the *"download the artifact zip from CI"* workflow.
- **Allure Report** — a mature, multi-framework report generator producing a rich static report. History across builds requires wiring previous results into each build, and there's no server, live view, or cross-run analytics in the open-source generator (that's the commercial TestOps product).
- **ReportPortal** — a mature, framework-agnostic, self-hosted test-ops platform with ML-based failure triage. It's built for organizations aggregating many frameworks, and its self-hosted footprint matches that ambition: a multi-service stack (API services, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, OpenSearch). Piwi trades that breadth for Playwright-native depth in a single container.
- **Currents** — a polished commercial SaaS for Playwright and Cypress: run history, flake detection, CI orchestration. It's managed and maintained for you; in exchange it's paid and your test data lives on their infrastructure.
- **Fault0** — the closest peer to Piwi: a newer, free, self-hosted, Playwright-only results dashboard with a one-line reporter, centralized run history, trace/screenshot/video debugging, notifications, and flaky-test trends. It targets the same "give your Playwright results a home" job. Where Piwi differs today is the depth of the analysis layer on top of that shared core — failure clustering, flaky **scoring** with CI-cost impact, locator healing, an MCP server for AI agents, and optional git-grounded AI diagnosis — so the honest split is *seeing* failures (both) versus *resolving* them (Piwi's focus). We've based this on Fault0's public docs and homepage; corrections welcome.

## Feature comparison

| | **Piwi** | Playwright HTML report | Allure Report | ReportPortal | Currents | Fault0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Run history across builds | ✅ | ❌ per-run | ➖ manual wiring | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Self-hosted | ✅ single container | — | ➖ static files | ✅ multi-service stack | ❌ SaaS | ✅ |
| Live run streaming | ✅ SSE, per-test | ❌ | ❌ | ➖ | ✅ | ➖ real-time status |
| Playwright traces, first-class | ✅ stored + viewer links | ✅ | ➖ attachments | ➖ attachments | ✅ | ✅ |
| Flaky detection & scoring | ✅ composite score, root-cause classes, CI-cost impact | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ➖ detection |
| Failure clustering | ✅ error fingerprinting | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ ML-based | ✅ | ➖ |
| AI failure diagnosis | ✅ optional, grounded in your git diff, patches validated server-side | ❌ | ❌ | ➖ ML triage | ➖ | ➖ |
| Locator healing suggestions | ✅ from prior passing runs | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ➖ |
| Plain-English steps, compiled | ✅ [AI steps](/features/ai-steps) — resolved once, replayed with zero model calls | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Web vitals & network capture | ✅ | ➖ in traces | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ➖ |
| MCP server for AI agents | ✅ 55 tools | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ➖ |
| Framework support | Playwright only (by design) | Playwright | Many | Many | Playwright, Cypress, Jest… | Playwright only |
| Price | Free, MIT | Free | Free | Free (self-host) / paid SaaS | Paid | Free, OSS |

In the **Fault0** column, ➖ marks a capability we did not find in its public docs at the time of writing (not necessarily a confirmed absence) — the two products share the core results-dashboard experience and differ mainly in Piwi's analysis depth. Corrections welcome.

## When Piwi is *not* the right choice

- **You aggregate many test frameworks** (JUnit, pytest, Cypress, …) into one place → ReportPortal or Allure fit better. Piwi is deliberately Playwright-only: the ingest API, trace handling, step analytics and locator healing are built around Playwright's model.
- **You want a managed service with CI orchestration** and someone else on the pager → Currents.
- **You only debug locally** and never look back at CI history → the built-in HTML report is already great.
- **You need a stable 1.0.** Piwi is pre-1.0: a minor release can carry breaking changes, and the database schema moves with it. Pin a version tag, keep backups, and read [Upgrading](/operate/upgrading) before you bump it.
- **You want an "ask AI" button.** Diagnosis is optional, grounded in your diff and evidence, and never in the write path.

## FAQ

### Is my data safe? Does Piwi phone home?

**Zero telemetry.** Piwi makes no outbound calls except the ones you configure; [Privacy & data flow](./privacy) lists each one.

### Does AI diagnosis send my code to a third party?

Only if you turn it on, and only to the [AI provider](./ai-provider) you configure, which can be a local model. [Privacy & data flow](./privacy) says what a diagnosis sends.

### SQLite or PostgreSQL?

Start with SQLite; switch to PostgreSQL when you want concurrent write headroom or your ops standard is Postgres. See [Database](/operate/database).

### Which Node version does the dashboard need?

Node 22 or newer, and only for `npx @piwitests/server`: the Docker image and the desktop app bundle their own runtime. The reporter in your test project needs Node 20 or later.

### Can I use it with Cypress / Jest / other frameworks?

No: Piwi is Playwright-only by design. See [when Piwi is not the right choice](#when-piwi-is-not-the-right-choice).

### Is it production-ready?

It is pre-1.0, tested across SQLite and PostgreSQL with local and S3 storage, and migrates its database on upgrade. See the [production checklist](/operate/production-checklist).

### How much disk/RAM does it need?

Modest; see [resource requirements](/operate/deployment#resource-requirements). Traces and reports take most of the disk.

### Where do I ask questions or propose features?

[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/PiwiTests/platform/discussions) for questions and ideas, [issues](https://github.com/PiwiTests/platform/issues) for bugs, and [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/PiwiTests/platform/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for direction.
