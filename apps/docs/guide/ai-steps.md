# AI steps

AI steps let you locate elements and drive flows in **plain English**, without giving up the determinism of hand-written Playwright:

```typescript
// Find one element by description
await page.piwiLocator('the email address field').fill('ada@example.com')

// Run a whole flow, with type-safe parameters
await page.piwiRun('sign in as {email}', { email: 'ada@example.com' })
```

The guiding principle is **the LLM is a compiler, not a runtime**. The first time a prompt is seen, an agent resolves it **once** into a committed, deterministic JSON artifact. Every run after that *replays* that artifact with ordinary Playwright calls — **zero LLM calls and zero network** in the default `replay` mode. Your CI stays fast, offline, and reproducible; the model is only ever involved while authoring.

::: tip This composes with the capture fixtures
AI steps are a separate opt-in from the [capture fixtures](./capture-fixtures), and compose with them. Replayed actions flow through the instrumented page, so they feed traces, reports, and [locator healing](/features/locator-healing) exactly like hand-written code.
:::

## Setup

Extend your test with `extendPiwiAi`. Compose it over `extendPiwiFixtures` to get the capture fixtures too:

```typescript
// tests/fixtures.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test'
import { extendPiwiFixtures, extendPiwiAi } from '@piwitests/reporter'

// AI steps + capture fixtures
export const test = extendPiwiAi(extendPiwiFixtures(base))
export { expect } from '@playwright/test'
```

`page` now carries two extra methods:

| Method | Returns | Use for |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `page.piwiLocator(template)` | a real, synchronous `Locator` | locating one element by description |
| `page.piwiRun(template)` | `Promise<void>` | replaying a compiled multi-step flow |

Placeholders are type-checked at compile time: a template with `{param}` **requires** a matching params object, and a misspelled or missing name is a TypeScript error.

```typescript
await page.piwiRun('add {qty} of {sku} to the cart', { qty: '2', sku: 'PIWI-1' })
```

## The lifecycle: author once, replay forever

An AI step moves through three modes, set with the `ai.mode` option or `PIWI_AI`:

| Mode | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `replay` *(default)* | Executes the committed artifact read-only. **Never** calls the model. Fails closed on a missing entry. |
| `resolve` | Authors any missing entry by driving the model, verifies it against the live page, and writes it to disk. |
| `heal` | Repairs a committed entry that no longer replays (e.g. a renamed element), without re-authoring from scratch. |

The intended workflow:

1. **Write** the test with `piwiLocator` / `piwiRun` prompts.
2. **Author** locally in `resolve` mode (see below). The agent produces a JSON artifact next to your spec under `__piwi__/`.
3. **Commit** that artifact to git alongside the test.
4. **Replay** everywhere else — locally and in CI — with zero model calls.

### Authoring (resolve mode)

Authoring needs a running Piwi dashboard with an AI provider configured (**Settings → AI**, or the `PIWI_AI_PROVIDER` [environment variables](/reference/configuration#ai-diagnosis)). The reporter sends each iteration to the server's resolution endpoint; the server calls the model and returns one decision, which the reporter compiles deterministically. **API keys stay on the server.**

Point the reporter at that server and run the suite in resolve mode:

```bash
export PIWI_DASHBOARD_URL="https://piwi.example.com"   # the authoring server
export PIWI_API_KEY="…"                                # a reporter API key
export PIWI_AI=resolve

npx playwright test           # or: npx piwi ai resolve --grep "sign in"
```

`piwi ai resolve` runs the suite in resolve mode for you (forcing `--workers=1` so authoring is serial). Once it finishes, review and **commit** the generated files.

::: warning Authoring drives the real page
In `resolve` mode each step is executed against the live page with your real parameter values so the flow can advance. Author against a disposable environment, not production.
:::

### Replay and CI

In `replay` mode a missing entry is a hard, actionable failure — the run does not silently pass and does not reach for a model:

```
piwi AI: no committed entry for "sign in as {email}" in test "checkout".
  expected file: tests/__piwi__/checkout.spec.ts/checkout.sign-in-as-email.a1b2c3d4.json
  run:  piwi ai resolve --grep "checkout"
```

That means an environment with no model access (a locked-down CI runner, an air-gapped box) can never accidentally author — it either replays a committed artifact or fails. If you would rather a missing entry mark the test **fixme** (yellow) instead of failing red, set `ai.onMiss: 'fixme'` (`PIWI_AI_ON_MISS=fixme`).

Because replay is plain Playwright, there is nothing extra to install or start in CI. Commit the artifacts and your existing test job replays them.

## What's inside an artifact — and why it's safe

An entry is **data, never code**: an allowlisted locator program plus, for a flow, an ordered list of steps and a postcondition oracle. Determinism and safety come from several guarantees:

- **Deterministic bytes.** The model only ever *names* an element (its ARIA role + accessible name). The [`@piwitests/core`](./concepts#locator-snapshot) scorer turns that into the committed locator, so model sampling never changes the file. Two runs that reach the same conclusion produce byte-identical JSON, and a no-op re-resolution leaves your working tree clean.
- **No evaluation.** Every locator method and action is checked against an allowlist before it touches the page. A tampered or malformed artifact can never become arbitrary execution.
- **Drift guard.** Each step records the element's role/name at author time. On replay, if the page positively shows that element has drifted (a rename), the flow **stops before acting** rather than clicking the wrong thing.
- **Postcondition oracle.** Every flow ends with an assertion the agent chose (an element became visible/hidden, or the URL changed). Replay verifies it, so a subtly wrong flow fails loudly instead of passing.
- **Ajax waiting, race-proof.** A step can wait for a network response it triggers (an XHR/fetch the agent observed while authoring). The wait is armed *before* the action fires, so a fast reply can never slip through the gap.

## Intent in the dashboard

Each test's replayed AI steps are reported to the dashboard as a small usage manifest: the committed artifacts it exercised (powering the project's **AI steps** liveness tab) plus **intent mappings** — each compiled locator paired with the prompt it came from. Two places use them:

- **Locator healing**: when the failing locator was compiled from a prompt, the healing panel shows it — *"Compiled from prompt: 'the email address field'"* — so you fix the intent, not just the selector.
- **AI diagnosis**: the diagnosis context includes an *AI Steps* section listing the prompts behind the test's locators, so a root cause can be phrased in intent terms ("the element the test calls *the email address field* was renamed"). Capped by `PIWI_AI_MAX_STEP_INTENTS` (default 20, `0` disables).

Intent mappings are as private as everything else here: templates keep their `{param}` placeholders and locators their `{{param}}` markers — parameter values never appear.

## Privacy

Parameter values are **masked out of everything sent to the model**. The page snapshot the agent sees has your `{param}` values replaced with markers, and placeholders survive compilation as markers that are substituted locally at replay. Secrets in parameters never leave your machine. See [Privacy & data flow](./privacy) for the full picture.

## The `piwi ai` CLI

```
piwi ai check     Scan committed entries for orphans, non-canonical files and
                  duplicate templates. Read-only; exits 1 when issues are found.
piwi ai resolve   Author missing entries by running the suite in resolve mode.
piwi ai prune     Delete orphaned/dormant entries.
```

`piwi ai check` is offline and CI-friendly — add it as a lint step to catch an entry whose prompt was deleted or renamed, a file that isn't in canonical form, or two prompts that collide:

```bash
npx piwi ai check          # exit 1 on any hygiene issue
npx piwi ai check --json   # machine-readable findings
```

## Configuration

Set these under the `ai` key of your reporter options (in `wrapConfig`'s second argument, or the reporter entry options). Every option has an environment-variable equivalent.

| Option | Env var | Default | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| `ai.mode` | `PIWI_AI` | `replay` | `replay` / `resolve` / `heal`. |
| `ai.dir` | `PIWI_AI_DIR` | `__piwi__` | Per-spec directory holding committed entries. |
| `ai.onMiss` | `PIWI_AI_ON_MISS` | `fail` | On a replay miss: `fail` (red) or `fixme` (yellow). |
| `ai.maxSteps` | `PIWI_AI_MAX_FLOW_STEPS` | `20` | Max steps the agent may take authoring one flow. |
| `ai.maxSnapshotChars` | `PIWI_AI_MAX_SNAPSHOT_CHARS` | `24000` | Max ARIA-snapshot characters sent per authoring iteration. |
| `ai.optionalProbeTimeout` | `PIWI_AI_OPTIONAL_PROBE_TIMEOUT` | `2000` | Existence-probe timeout (ms) for an `optional` step during replay. |
| `ai.responseWaitTimeout` | `PIWI_AI_RESPONSE_WAIT_TIMEOUT` | Playwright default | Timeout (ms) for a step's `waitForResponse`, and the authoring settle window. |
| `ai.screenshotFallback` | `PIWI_AI_SCREENSHOT_FALLBACK` | `false` | Send a screenshot when the ARIA snapshot is empty (**vision models only**). |

Authoring also reads `PIWI_DASHBOARD_URL` and `PIWI_API_KEY` (the server that runs the model), and `PIWI_AI_UPDATE=true` (or `--update-ai`) forces re-authoring of entries that already exist.

On the **server** side, two limits bound each authoring iteration — see the [AI steps section](/reference/configuration#ai-steps) of the configuration reference:

- `PIWI_AI_STEP_MAX_SNAPSHOT_CHARS` — snapshot characters the model receives.
- `PIWI_AI_STEP_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` — output tokens the model may return. **Reasoning models** spend tokens on hidden chain-of-thought, so raise this (up to `8192`) when authoring with one, or the JSON decision can be truncated.
