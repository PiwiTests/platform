# Privacy & data flow

Test results are unusually revealing: they carry your source paths, error messages, screenshots of your
app, network calls, and sometimes your git history. That's a good reason to know exactly where the
bytes go. This page is the inventory.

The short version: **there is no telemetry**, no usage analytics, no crash reporting, and no license or
activation call. The server never checks for updates; the desktop app checks once at startup (turn that off in
**Settings → About**) and when you click **Check for updates** there. Every outbound call the server makes is listed
below, and all but two are something you switched on. An instance running on an air-gapped network works the same as
one on the internet.

## What leaves your server

Every outbound connection Piwi can make:

| Destination | When | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| Your AI provider | Only if you configure [AI diagnosis](/features/ai-diagnosis) | The diagnosis context: error text, failing steps, test and related source files, console and network entries, page (ARIA/DOM) snapshots, server logs, the relevant git diff, and up to five failure screenshots by default (`PIWI_AI_MAX_IMAGES=0` sends none). [AI-step](/features/ai-steps) authoring sends masked page snapshots |
| Your git host | Whenever runs report a GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket remote (the reporter records `origin` by default) | Without a token: anonymous public-API reads of the repository's default branch and its CODEOWNERS; the desktop app reads a project's linked clone with `git` instead, and asks the host only for a commit the clone lacks. With a token: commits, diffs and files, plus the PR comments, commit statuses, heal branches and CI re-runs of the features you turn on |
| A URL you attach as a link | When someone adds a link to a run, test or cluster | A request for its title (the git host's API for an issue or PR link) |
| Your issue tracker (Jira) | Only if you [connect it](/features/issue-tracking) | Issue reads, and the issues and comments you file |
| Your SMTP server | Only if you configure [email notifications](/features/notifications) | Notification and account emails |
| Your Slack / webhook URLs | Only for subscriptions you create | The event payload (run status, cluster, test names, file paths, short error excerpts) |
| Your S3 endpoint | Only if you switch [storage](/operate/storage) to S3 | Trace files, HTML reports, attachments |
| Google / GitHub | Only if you enable [OAuth sign-in](/operate/authentication#oauth-google-github) | The standard OAuth exchange |

The reporter sends your own instance what its options switch on. [Code reach](/features/code-reach), off by
default, sends repository-relative file paths only: never source code, coverage counts or line numbers.

Two rows need no setting: the anonymous git-host reads happen whenever runs report a public-host remote,
and a link's title is fetched when someone attaches it. Both fail quietly without network access.
Everything else is off until you configure it.

The **AI provider** is the one worth pausing on, because it's the only destination that receives your
source code and the full failure context. It's opt-in, it goes only to the endpoint *you* set — including a local
model over Ollama or vLLM, in which case nothing leaves the machine at all — you can preview the exact
context before it's sent, and you can cap its size. See
[AI diagnosis → Privacy](/features/ai-diagnosis#privacy).

## What never leaves your server

- **Traces.** The Playwright trace viewer is bundled and served by your own instance at
  `/trace-viewer/`. Opening a trace from Piwi never uploads it anywhere — unlike sending a colleague to
  the hosted `trace.playwright.dev`.
- **The API reference.** `/docs` is rendered in-app from your instance's own OpenAPI spec, with no
  third-party CDN, so it works offline.
- **Screenshots, videos, HTML reports.** Stored on your disk or your S3 bucket, served by your instance.
- **HTML report execution.** Reports run with scripts enabled inside a CSP sandbox with a unique opaque origin. Piwi
  provides the report with an in-memory Web Storage facade so Playwright's settings UI works; it is discarded with the
  report document and cannot read the dashboard's cookies or local storage. Uploaded reports remain untrusted active
  content.
- **Your IDE mapping.** The [Open in IDE](/features/ide-integration) workspace root lives in your browser's
  local storage, because the source is on your machine, not the server's. It is never sent to the
  dashboard.

## What reaches your server from Piwi Picker

The [browser extension](/features/extension) works with no instance. Connected, it reads a project's URL patterns,
function catalog and locator index, and sends one thing: a [bug report](/features/bug-reports), only when someone
clicks **Send** in its preview, which shows exactly what goes. That report carries the recorded steps with the values
typed (never a password, and none at all with **Leave out the values I typed**), and whichever evidence the reporter
kept ticked: screenshots of the tab, console errors and warnings, failed requests (method, path without query values,
status; never a header or a body) and an outline of the page. It goes only to the instance the extension is connected
to, and it is stored there like a run's evidence.

**Share result**, after a replay of a report from the instance, sends the verdict, the site it ran on and the
browser's name to that report, on **Send** in its preview.

Paired with the [desktop app](/features/bug-reports#running-it-with-playwright-in-the-desktop-app), it also sends a
report's title and steps, with their typed values and nothing else, to that app on this machine when someone clicks
**Send** in the **Run with Playwright** preview.

## What Piwi deliberately does not capture

Some data is skipped at the source, so it never exists to leak:

- **Input values in locator snapshots.** The [capture fixtures](./capture-fixtures) record what an
  element *is* — role, accessible name, test id — never what was typed into it. Playwright's own records
  are different: step titles and parameters, traces and the failure-time ARIA snapshot include the values
  a test typed, password fields too, so don't fill real secrets in tests.
- **Page-inventory field contents.** The optional [page inventory](./reporter#configuration-options)
  (`capturePageInventory`, **off by default**) records the names of a page's controls and links so the
  dashboard can tell which the suite never exercises. The name of a control that holds user input — a
  textbox, `select`, `textarea` or contenteditable editor — is never read from its content, so a
  recovery code, a draft, or a set of options never leaves the browser; link hrefs are stripped of their
  query and hash, which can carry signed tokens.
- **Storage and cookie values.** Page state records the *names* of `localStorage` /`sessionStorage`
  keys and their value lengths, and cookie names with their flags. Never the values.
- **Sensitive headers.** `Authorization`, `Cookie` and friends are masked server-side in Piwi's trace
  network view, and token-shaped strings in URLs and bodies are masked too. The trace file itself is
  stored as uploaded, so the bundled trace viewer and a downloaded trace still show them.
- **Backend logs, in production.** The [backend-log integrations](./backend-logs) emit their header only
  in development and test environments by default.

## Secrets at rest

Credentials you store in the dashboard — AI API keys, SCM tokens, webhook signing secrets — are
encrypted with AES-256-GCM using `PIWI_SECRET_KEY`. **Set it in production.** With the variable unset,
or set to the development default published in this repository, the dashboard refuses to save a
credential and says which variable to set. Generate a key with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

API keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes and shown exactly once, at creation. A leaked database gives an
attacker no usable key.

Secrets provided by environment variable are never written to the database and never returned by the
API — the settings UI shows them as read-only with a lock badge.

## The demo

The [live demo](https://piwitests.dev/demo/) has no backend. It runs the real application against
an in-browser SQLite database seeded with fake data, inside a service worker. Nothing you click there
reaches a server, and there is nothing for it to collect.

## Retention

Data you keep is data you're responsible for. Piwi can prune it for you: set `PIWI_RETENTION_DAYS` for
nightly automatic pruning of old runs and their files, or delete in bulk from **Settings → Storage**.
Deleting a run removes its executions, traces, reports, and any evidence payloads no longer referenced
by anything else. See [Storage → Data retention](/operate/storage#data-retention).

## Verifying any of this

You don't have to take the page's word for it. The source is public and the outbound surface is
small enough to audit: watch the container's egress, or read
[`server/utils/`](https://github.com/PiwiTests/platform/tree/main/apps/application/server/utils) — the AI
provider, SCM, SMTP, notification, OAuth, Jira and link-unfurl clients are the only things there that open
a socket; the S3 client is in `server/storage/`.
