# Feature map

Everything Piwi does, in one place — what each feature is, what it needs beyond
a running [reporter](/guide/reporter), where it lives in the dashboard, and the
page that explains it. Features are grouped by the three jobs the product serves:
**keep the history**, **explain the failures**, and **hand back a fix** — plus how
you reach them from elsewhere and what an operator runs.

New here? Start with [What Piwi does](/guide/what-piwi-does) and [Getting started](/guide/getting-started); this map is the "where next" once a first run has landed. The last two sections list the pieces you install and the decisions a setup involves.

${decisionsMarkdown}`;
