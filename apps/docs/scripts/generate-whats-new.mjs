/**
 * Generates apps/docs/reference/whats-new.md — the "what's new" page — from the
 * repository CHANGELOG.md.
 *
 * The page is a build artifact (gitignored): `docs:dev` and `docs:build` run
 * this first, so it can never drift from the changelog. It lists the *feature*
 * entries of every release (raw release-please sections and polished notes
 * alike, read by `apps/application/shared/changelog.ts`) grouped by minor
 * version, newest first, with commit links stripped — the answer to "what changed since I last
 * upgraded". Bug fixes and the full history stay in CHANGELOG.md, linked at the
 * top. To change the page, cut a release; do not edit it here.

# What's new

The features that landed in each release, newest first — the answer to "what
changed since I last upgraded, and is any of it worth reading about". It is
generated from the project [changelog](https://github.com/PiwiTests/platform/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md),
which also holds the bug fixes and the full commit history.

Piwi is pre-1.0: minor releases can carry breaking changes and the database
schema moves with them, so read [Upgrading](/operate/upgrading) before you bump a tag.
