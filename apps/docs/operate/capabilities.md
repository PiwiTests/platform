# Choose what you use

The **Setup** page (`/setup`, administrators only) is the permanent home for "how do I connect this, and what else can it do?". Above the connect steps it asks one coarse question, *What do you want Piwi for?*, with **See why tests fail** always on and three opt-out groups: **Triage as a team** (notifications, quarantine, pull-request feedback, issue tracking), **Fix faster** (locator healing, auto-heal), and **Let agents in** (AI diagnosis). Below it, a ladder lists every optional capability grouped by state: **Active** (evidence has arrived), **Available** (configured but not used yet), **Not set up**, and a folded **Declined** group.

## Declining a capability

Not every team uses every capability. Any optional one can be **declined** so the dashboard stops showing it everywhere: the evidence tabs, empty panels, settings page, sidebar entry, project actions and MCP tools it owns all go, rather than lingering half-visible. Decline instance-wide from the Setup ladder (*Not for this instance*) or the presets, or per project from the **Capabilities** section of the project's **Settings** tab and the places the capability appears (for example the execution page's evidence footer, *Not for this project*). A project override can also **enable** a capability the instance declined.

Declining is administrator-only and never final: each declined capability keeps a *Reconsider* link on the Setup ladder that clears the decision, and because data always wins, a declined capability that starts receiving data reads as active again with the stored decision shown next to it. See [Why a card is empty](/features/evidence#why-a-card-is-empty) for how this reads on the execution page.
