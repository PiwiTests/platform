# Backup & restore

Piwi's migrations are **forward-only** — once a new version has migrated your database, an older version will not run against it correctly. So a backup is not just insurance against disk loss; it is the *only* rollback path. Take one before every version bump.

## What to back up

Everything lives in two places — back up both, together:

1. **The database** — the SQLite file `.data/piwi.db` (the default), or your PostgreSQL database.
2. **File storage** — `.data/storage/` (HTML reports, traces, attachments), unless you keep artifacts in [S3](./storage#s3-compatible-storage), in which case the bucket is your storage backup.

The two must be consistent with each other: a database row points at a stored trace, so a backup that captures one without the other can dangle. The simplest way to guarantee consistency is to stop the container before copying; the online methods below avoid the downtime.

## Backing up

::: code-group

```bash [SQLite (online, no downtime)]
# Consistent SQLite snapshot without stopping the server, plus the storage dir
sqlite3 .data/piwi.db ".backup '.data/piwi-backup.db'"
tar czf piwi-backup.tar.gz -C .data piwi-backup.db storage
```

```bash [PostgreSQL]
pg_dump "$PIWI_DATABASE_URL" > piwi-db.sql
tar czf piwi-storage.tar.gz -C .data storage   # skip if artifacts are in S3
```

```powershell [Windows (stop first)]
# Stop the container for a consistent copy, then archive .data
Compress-Archive -Path .data -DestinationPath piwi-backup.zip
```

:::

If artifacts are in S3, lean on the bucket's own durability and versioning rather than copying `.data/storage/`. Keep the database backup and the storage backup from the *same moment* so they agree.

## Restoring

Restoring is also how you roll back after an upgrade goes wrong — the rollback path is "restore your backup", never "pull the old tag" against an already-migrated database.

1. **Stop the container.**
2. **Restore the database and `.data/storage/`** from a backup pair taken at the same time. For SQLite, put `piwi-backup.db` back as `.data/piwi.db` and unpack the storage archive; for PostgreSQL, restore the dump into an empty database (`psql "$PIWI_DATABASE_URL" < piwi-db.sql`).
3. **Start the version the backup was taken on.** A backup from version *N* must be restored under version *N* (or newer, which will migrate it forward) — not an older one.

Then confirm the running version at **Settings → About**, and that recent runs are present. See [Upgrading](./upgrading) for the full version-change story and the checks that tell you a migration landed.

## The desktop app

The [desktop build](/features/desktop) bundles its own server, and its database and storage live in a per-machine data directory *outside* the app bundle, migrated on first launch exactly as the server does — so the same forward-only rule applies. Back up that data directory before a major version jump; a newer build will migrate it, an older one cannot open it.

## When to back up

- **Before every version bump** — this is the one that matters, because it is the only rollback path.
- **On a schedule** matched to how much history you would hate to lose — nightly is plenty for most teams.
- Retention pruning deletes runs permanently; if you want a longer tail than your [retention window](./storage#data-retention) keeps, a periodic backup is where that history lives.
