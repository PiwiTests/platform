# Our suite takes too long — where is the time actually going?

The instinct is to look for slow tests. That is usually the smallest part of the bill. A suite's wall
clock is mostly made of four things, and only one of them is "the app is slow":

1. **Waits somebody wrote** — `waitForTimeout` sleeps that were a workaround once.
2. **Timeouts nobody revisited** — a 30s budget on a test that takes 3s costs 27s *every time it fails*.
3. **Retries of flaky tests** — paid on every run, and they buy no signal.
4. **The application itself** — the only part that needs a real fix.

Piwi measures all four separately, so you can spend effort where the minutes are. It does not make your
app faster; it tells you whether that is even the problem.

## 1. Split the bill before optimizing anything

[Analytics](/features/analytics) has two widgets that belong side by side: **CI time** (total minutes your runs
consumed) and **Wasted CI time** — the portion that produced no signal, defined as time inside wait
steps plus time spent on attempts that ended failed or timed out.

If wasted time is a small slice, your suite is just big: look at the application and parallelism (steps 5
and 6). If it is a large slice, start with steps 2 to 4.

The widget also states how much is **reclaimable** by tightening timeouts and dropping stale
`test.slow()` marks.

## 2. Reclaim the waits you wrote

Piwi classifies wait steps as **wasted time** and totals them per execution and per run. By default
only explicit sleeps count — `waitForTimeout` and friends — because framework-injected waits
(load-state, wait-for-function) are usually unavoidable and would drown the signal.

- A failing execution's summary shows the wasted time spent in fixed waits, right next to its duration.
- A run's **Timeline** tab draws a per-worker timeline: turn on **Show waits** and the sleeps show as bars that
  open the test.
- Tune what counts in **Settings → Performance** (or lock it with
  [`PIWI_WASTED_WAIT_PATTERNS`](/reference/configuration#wasted-time)). Classification happens *when a run is
  viewed*, so widening the patterns re-classifies your whole history with no re-run.

</figure>

Set the patterns to `*` once to see how much of the suite is waiting on something, then set them back.

## 3. Tighten the timeouts that only bill you on failure

An oversized per-test timeout is free while tests pass and brutal when they don't: a hung test burns
its entire budget before anyone learns anything.

The **Performance** tab's **Timeout opportunities** lists tests whose configured timeout dwarfs their
real p95 duration, plus tests still carrying a `test.slow()` mark they have outgrown. Each row suggests
a tighter value and the time reclaimable per failing run, ranked by impact.

<figure>
  <img src="/screenshots/performance-trends.png" alt="Project Performance tab showing the duration trend chart with total, average and P90 series and timeline markers, above the slowest-tests table">
  <figcaption>The Performance tab: average and P90 duration over time, then the ranked slowest tests.</figcaption>
</figure>

Read the **P90** line, not the average: a handful of slow outliers move P90 and barely move the mean,
and it's the outliers that decide how long a shard takes.

## 4. Stop paying for flaky retries

A flaky test bills you twice, for the failed attempt and for the retry, on every run where it misbehaves.
That is why Piwi ranks flaky tests by **wasted CI minutes** rather than by flakiness score: a test that flakes
often but finishes in 200ms costs little, and one that flakes weekly on a four-minute timeout hurts.

[Cutting the flakiness that costs the most](./flaky-cleanup) is the whole recipe for this. The short
version: sort by impact, fix the red dots, and
[quarantine](/features/flaky-tests#quarantine-with-a-way-out) the rest so they stop blocking merges while
still running.

## 5. Ask whether the app is slow, not the test

Everything above shaves time off the harness; this step finds a real performance bug.

- **[Slow endpoints](/features/slow-tests)**: on a run, network requests grouped by normalized route with their
  duration and error rate; [Analytics](/features/analytics) lifts the same view across every project.
- **Web Vitals**: TTFB, FCP, LCP, CLS and the rest per execution. LCP, CLS and INP are Chromium-only.

Both require the [capture fixtures](/guide/capture-fixtures): the reporter alone cannot see the network.
Without them you still have the trace: its network waterfall shows the same requests for one execution,
just not aggregated across the suite.

## 6. Spend the parallelism you already have

- **Worker imbalance** is called out in a run's [Timeline](/features/ui-overview#test-run-detail) tab, under the worker
  distribution: if one worker finishes long after the others, the suite is as slow as its unluckiest shard, and no
  amount of per-test tuning fixes that.
- **Sharding** is Playwright's own `--shard`; Piwi merges the shards back into [one
  run](/guide/concepts#test-run), so you can raise the shard count without turning your history into
  fragments. See [CI & sharding](/guide/ci#sharding).

## Other ways in

**Ask your agent.** Over the [MCP server](/features/mcp), `get_slow_tests` returns the ranked slowest tests,
`get_performance_trend` the duration history, and `get_run_insights` the worker imbalance of one run.

**Script it.** The same numbers are on the REST API: see the [API docs](https://piwitests.dev/demo/docs).

**Watch it drift.** Rather than auditing periodically, subscribe to the `perf.regression`
[notification](/features/notifications) event and let it tell you when a duration trend breaks.
