# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving Piwi Dashboard! This file covers dev setup, tests, and commit/PR conventions. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for architecture, project structure, and the full development guide.

## Getting set up

Prerequisites: **Node.js 24+**, npm, Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PiwiTests/platform.git
cd platform/apps/application
npm install
npm run app:dev      # dashboard at http://localhost:3000
```

The SQLite database and `.data/` storage are created automatically on first API call — no configuration needed. To hack on the reporter package instead, work in `packages/reporter/` (`npm run reporter:build`, or `npm run reporter:dev` for watch mode).

## Quality checks & tests

Run from `apps/application/` unless noted:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run app:lint` | Lint (oxlint) |
| `npm run app:typecheck` | TypeScript check |
| `npm run app:format:check` | Formatting (oxfmt) |
| `npm run app:test:unit` | Unit tests (Vitest) |
| `npm run app:test` | E2E tests (Playwright — needs browsers: `npx playwright install chromium`) |
| `npm test` | Everything (unit first, then E2E) |
| `npm run reporter:test` | Reporter unit tests (from `packages/reporter/`) |

If an E2E test creates a project, use a static name registered in `apps/application/shared/test-project-names.ts` (see the conventions in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)).

## Database & demo data

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate a SQLite migration from schema changes |
| `npm run db:generate:pg` | Generate a PostgreSQL migration from schema changes |
| `npm run db:studio` | Browse the SQLite database in Drizzle Studio |
| `npm run db:studio:pg` | Browse the PostgreSQL database in Drizzle Studio |
| `npm run app:seed:demo` | Regenerate the demo seed data used by the live demo |

**Migration workflow:** edit `server/database/schema.sqlite.ts` (and `schema.pg.ts` for the PostgreSQL equivalent — `schema.ts` is just a dialect-selecting re-export, don't edit it) → run `npm run db:generate` (SQLite) or `npm run db:generate:pg` (PostgreSQL) → review the generated `.sql` file → restart the app. Never create migration files or edit `meta/_journal.json` by hand — the Drizzle migrator depends on the journal to track which migrations have been applied, and manual entries cause it to silently skip the migration.

## What to work on

- Check [open issues](https://github.com/PiwiTests/platform/issues) and the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
- For anything non-trivial, open an issue or a [Discussion](https://github.com/PiwiTests/platform/discussions) first so we can agree on the approach before you invest time.
- Security problems: follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — please don't open public issues for those.

## Commit messages & PR titles

This repo uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), enforced by commitlint (locally and in CI) and a PR-title check. [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) reads commit history to compute version bumps and generate the changelog, so following this format isn't just style — it's what makes releases work.

Because PRs are squash-merged, **the PR title becomes the commit message on `main`** — that's what release-please actually reads. Give the PR itself a Conventional Commit title; individual commits within the PR are not required to follow the format, though it's good practice.

### Format

```
type(scope): subject
```

- `type` — required, one of the types below
- `scope` — optional but encouraged, one of the scopes below
- `subject` — required, lowercase, no trailing period, imperative mood ("add", not "added"/"adds")

### Types → release bump

| Type | Bump | Appears in changelog |
|---|---|---|
| `feat:` | **minor** (0.x.0) | 🚀 Features |
| `fix:` / `perf:` | **patch** (0.0.x) | 🐛 Fixes |
| `feat!:` / `fix!:` / body with `BREAKING CHANGE:` | **major**\* | ⚠ Breaking |
| `docs:` `chore:` `ci:` `refactor:` `test:` `build:` `style:` `revert:` | none | hidden |

\* Pre-1.0, breaking changes bump **minor** instead of major (`bump-minor-pre-major` in `release-please-config.json`).

### Scopes

`app`, `reporter`, `db`, `ui`, `demo`, `desktop`, `extension`, `ci`, `docs`, `deps`, `auth`, `ai`, `notifications`,
`release`

(`main` is also allowed, but only appears in release-please's own auto-generated `chore(main): release X.Y.Z` PRs — don't use it for your own commits.)

### Examples

```
feat(reporter): send reporter version with each test run
fix(db): correct null handling in flaky-test aggregation
docs: update configuration reference
ci: add commitlint workflow
feat(auth)!: require email verification before login

BREAKING CHANGE: unverified accounts can no longer sign in.
```

### Enforcement

1. **Local `commit-msg` hook** (husky + commitlint) — runs on every `git commit` after `npm install`. Bypassable with `--no-verify`; treat it as convenience, not a gate.
2. **`Lint commits` CI check** — lints every commit in a PR's range on push.
3. **`Lint PR title` CI check** — lints the PR title itself, since that's what becomes the squash-merge commit subject. This is the check that actually gates `main`.

## Releases

Merging a release-please PR (titled `chore(main): release X.Y.Z`) tags the release and publishes it, but this requires one-time repo setup — without it, releases silently stop at the tag and the npm/NuGet publish workflows never fire:

1. **`Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions`** — check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** (org-level setting too, if the repo checkbox is greyed out). Without this, `release-please.yml` fails with `GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests`.
2. **A `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` repo secret** — a Personal Access Token (classic `repo` scope, or fine-grained with `Contents: read/write` + `Pull requests: read/write`) or a GitHub App installation token, added at `Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`. This is required because GitHub's anti-recursion protection means a tag created with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does **not** trigger other `on: push: tags` workflows — `publish.yml`, `publish-instrumentation.yml`, and `publish-nuget.yml` would never run even though the tag exists. A PAT/App token isn't subject to that restriction.

If a release's tag already exists but the packages never published (e.g. because this wasn't set up yet), re-run the affected workflow manually against that tag — `publish.yml` / `publish-instrumentation.yml` / `publish-nuget.yml` all have a `workflow_dispatch` trigger for exactly this.
